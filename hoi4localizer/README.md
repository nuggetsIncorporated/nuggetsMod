<br> hoi4 mod: North America Divided - <hyperlink> https://discord.gg/AyJY59BcbM </hyperlink> 

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Use the batch file to run the hoi4localizer.jar, as the jar file tends to immediately close.
<br> You need Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 17 or greater. Java SDK/JDK also should work.

To report bugs mention me in the North America Divided server, or my discord id: BattleSkorpion#0679

<b>I  strongly recommend</b>  using git/Github to back up your mod. I assume no responsibility if
this application corrupts/breaks or inadvertently or incorrectly alters any personal files or other, or 
causes any other issues. It <i>should</i> not, but of course, the program is complicated, and by using this 
application, you acknowledge that you understand the risks of use, <i> especially if your mod files are not
backed up in some form.</i>

Some features are WIP, and may not work as intended.
