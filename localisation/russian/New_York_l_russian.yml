 SNY_failing_democracy: "Failing Democracy"
 SNY_failing_democracy_desc: "We have been unable to hold our country together. Be it through political deadlock or an extremist leader coming to power, our democracy is failing but the general populous still cry for Democracy to return. It will not be an easy fight to take it away from them."

 SNY_self_proclaimed_bastion_of_democracy_desc: "New York stands as a testament that Democracy in America can still work. While many have abandoned Democracy, or have become Pseudo-Democracies at best, we will stay true to the American Dream! If only that were true..."

 SNY_political_deadlock: "Political Deadlock"
 SNY_political_deadlock_desc: "Ever since the impeachment of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the country has been in an unstable state. Congress is divided between Progressives and Democrats, those who are still loyal to FDR and those who are loyal to the state."
 SNY_political_violence: "Political Violence"
 SNY_political_violence_desc: "The political deadlock faced before has begun to turn violent. Progressives and Democrats continue to butt heads and other members have turned to fringe and, often, more radical ideologies. While there is still a strong core of pro-Democracy members in Congress, more and more members are advocating for much more radical solutions to our crises. Some of these members will stop at nothing to advance their political goals, even going so far as hiring private police to do dirty work."
  
 SNY_legacy_of_FDRs_impeachment: "Legacy of FDR's Impeachment"
 SNY_legacy_of_FDRs_impeachment_desc: "New York was one of the last states to secede from the Union. This reluctance was mostly thanks to Franklin D. Roosevelt. As the United States of America continued to fracture and plunge deeper into chaos, New York remained a strong ally to the Government in D.C.. That is, until Fiorello La Guardia, the mayor of New York City, found it best for the city if it was independent from the Union. Fiorello made many formal requests to FDR for the whole state of New York to finally secede from the Union, but FDR refused. Nearing the end of 1932, Fiorello threatened to secede from not only the Union but also the state of New York if things did not change. With the threat of loosing the largest and most important city of New York, the New York State Assembly and Senate pushed to remove FDR from office. In the process of impeachment, many local militias of New York State - funded by New York City - revolted against the United State's Government. This revolt would result in New York becoming the second to last state to secede from the union in December 1932. Now an independent republic, New York State officialized the impeachment of FDR and FDR subsequently fled to the District of Columbia. The New York State Assembly and Senate formed the Congress of this new nation. The next Congress would come to be more loyal to the ideals of FDR, but nothing could be done because he was impeached. Around half of Congress and many of the people of New York remember FDR fondly, the strong memory of FDR will persist in New York until another leader can come to power to satisfy the needs of the people."
  
 SNY_independent_new_york_city: "Independent New York City"
 SNY_independent_new_york_city_desc: "The impeachment of Franklin D. Roosevelt was driven in large part because of the threat that New York City would secede from New York State if the State would not secede from the failing Union. Despite the impeachment eventually passing, the damage was already done. New York City no longer trusted that its best interests were being looked out for by the State. In a compromise, New York City became a highly autonomous region of New York State, with its own politics and many of the powers of an independent country."

 new_york.1.t: "The Army Questions the Ability of the Administration"
 new_york.1.d: "The Army has called into question the ability of Herbert Lehman and the administration as a whole to run New York State. They say that if things do not change soon, the country will reach a breaking point and they do not want to be the ones dealing with such a mistake. The Army has told Lehman to either fix the country or they will fix it themselves."

 new_york.2.t: "The Navy Questions the Ability of the Administration"
 new_york.2.d: "Following the example of the army, the Navy has formally questioned the ability of the Administration. Echoing many of the same points of the army, The Navy has stated that if things do not get better soon, they will shift their allegiance to other countries as they see fit. The Navy has told Lehman to either fix the country or they will abandon us."
 new_york.2.a: "Not the Navy!"
  
 new_york.3.t: "The Military Abandons the Capital"
 new_york.3.d: "With the situation in the country still not improving, the army has shown that they were not joking around when they said that the country must be fixed. Every guard, soldier, and other armed personnel have been moved away from the capital in protest. The leading generals have told us that if the country becomes stable once again, they will return to guarding the capital building, but for now they stated they are done attacking peaceful protesters."
 new_york.3.a: "What's the Worst that Could Happen?"
  
 new_york.4.t: "Herbert H. Lehman Criticizes the Army"
 new_york.4.d: "Herbert H. Lehman, the president of New York State, made a speech this morning criticizing the actions of The Army. \"While The Army may have criticized me and my administration, I have never performed an action so foolish as to abandon the capital building in a time of great need and instability for this great country we all call home. It is clear to me that their action was uninformed and I hope they see the error in this act and decide to return to defend the capital building in Albany.\" Lehman's speech did little to change the mind or hearts of The Army and the people who support their actions."
 new_york.4.a: "There's Nothing we can do to stop Them"
 new_york.4.b: "The Country Shouldn't need us There Anyway!"
  
 new_york.5.t: "The Albany Attack"
 new_york.5.d: "Early this morning, the usual protest gathered in front of the capital building in Albany. Without the army there to threaten the protesters, the size of the protest was the largest since the breakup of the Union. On the streets, the protesters called for true democracy in the republic, for Franklin D. Roosevelt to return, for the end of the slaughter of innocent protesters by the hands of the police and - until recently - the army, and or change. \"We demand Life! We demand Liberty! We demand the Right to Pursue Happiness!\" Their cries could be heard for blocks and blocks surrounding the capital building in Albany. Herbert H. Lehman attempted to address the crowd like he always does. \"I have been trying my hardest to bring Life, Liberty, and Happiness to the people of New York. But it is Congress, not I, that continually wishes to stifle our Democracy and keep our country in a situation of prolonged political deadlock!\" Lehman's speech was cut short by the sound of gunfire radiating from the crowd. Immediately, Lehman retreated into the capital building for his own safety. Soon after, a poorly known, radical left congressman walked out from the crowd and gave his speech, his firearm concealed by his suit. \"Brothers in arms, we have gathered here today not because we are satisfied and to tell Lehman he's done a good job, we have gathered here today because was are DISSATISFIED and because Lehman has NOT done a good job.\" He paused for a brief applause from the crowd. \"Today is the day we must show Lehman just how unsatisfied we are with his administration!\" More applause. \"Now follow me fellow citizens of New York, follow me in my, in our, attack on the very administration that has made our lives hell! WHEN THE CLOCK STRIKES NOON, WE ATTACK!\" More applause erupted from the crowd, many of them now blinded by the words of the congressman many of them didn't even know was a congressman. When the hour was noon, what would become known as \"The Albany Attack\" commenced. While initially lead by the congressman from before, he eventually retreated because he knew violence would ensue. In the end over two dozen protesters and guards were killed in the attack before the rest of the crowd was discouraged and gave up. While the number of people killed may have not been as much as in other tragic event in the past, it was enough to demonstrate the political instability in New York, the political violence. This attack will surely change the course of the country forever and will be remembered for many generations to come."

Every time I worked in the background to fix those mistake, undo the blunders, and keep this country stable. But out of all the stupid things he's done, canceling the elections has to be up there. This is not a mistake I can fix from the background! In order to undo this damage and restore faith in not only our democracy, but in the Republic of New York as a whole, I have to take drastic measures. Over the next few months, I will work to get Mr. Lehman impeached for his crimes against the integrity of our democracy!\"."

 new_york.20.d: "Through any means necessary, The Army is looking to expand their influence.

Mulcahy, George Decker, and Bruce C. Clarke confronted Herbert H. Lehman inside the capital building with the security of a part of the nation's army just outside. Their request was simple. Step down as president of New York and as the Commander in Chief, and The Army would take over control. While Herbert H. Lehman did not want to agree to these terms, the military force just outside the building persuaded him otherwise. Lehman signed over New York to The Army. Lehman was then promptly kicked out of the capital building and The Army moved to make their rule over New York official."
 new_york.21.a: "We Welcome our new Administration"
  
 new_york.22.t: "The Question of Leadership"
 new_york.22.d: "While the Military Council has been doing its job thus far, it is merely a temporary leader, a regent, as we sort out the actual leader. The first candidate is Francis P. Mulcahy, a naval aviator with some experience with the land, sea, and the air. The second candidate is Bruce C. Clarke, a leader who mostly has experience with land forces and has extensive experience with support engineers. The third candidate is George Decker, a leader who shows a lot of promise and has been rising quickly in the ranks of the military, he is an infantry leader at heart and completely despises the Navy"

 new_york.23.d: "Congress has been a constant thorn in the side for our military leadership of New York. We may have bypassed them to come to power, but their influence can still be felt throughout the country. While theoretically, they have no power over us, their constant bickering and in-fighting has caused all of our decrees and actions to take much longer to perform. In order to deal with this threat, we have decided to silence every Congressman and Congresswoman. They won't be causing any more trouble any time soon."
 new_york.23.a: "All in the name of Stability"
  
 new_york.24.t: "The Navy Criticizes the new Leadership"

 new_york.36.t: "Hire a Lawyer"
 new_york.36.d: "While Charles Poletti is an experienced lawyer himself, many would think that him being the prosecutor against Herbert H. Lehman would be biased.

 new_york.37.t: "Charles Poletti Deals with the Impeachment Himself"
 new_york.37.d: "When it comes down to it, Charles can't completely trust anyone else with this impeachment. While he knows that with the evidence he can uncover he can get Lehman impeached, he's unsure if another lawyer would be immune to bribes or would deliver the evidence in a convincing way. Because of these uncertainties, Charles decided that he should deal with the impeachment of Herbert H. Lehman himself."

Money exchanging hands to ensure an election, black mail to pass a bill without worry, and assassinations on those who dare to question him. It's time for Charles Poletti to expose this corruption in preparation for the trail."

 new_york.39.t: "Expose Lehman's Mistakes"
 new_york.39.d: "In Charles' many years working under and for Lehman, he has seen blunders beyond comprehension. Bills written that make no sense. Speeches written with no grammatical structure. He can't even hire his own advisors. Throughout Herbert H. Lehman's administration, it has been Charles Poletti trying his hardest to make sure everything doesn't fall apart."
 new_york.39.a: "What an Incompetent Leader"
  
 new_york.40.t: "Expose Lehman's Backdoor Dealings"
 new_york.40.d: "In Charles' many years working under and for Lehman, he has seen deals that, alone, would have ended his presidency. Political silencing to win elections and pass bills. Underhanded deals to secure funding for his administration. Charles Poletti is finally exposing these dealings to the world, everyone deserves to know!"

 new_york.41.d: "Pen in hand, Jay Lovestone presses it against the soft paper gently laying against his desk. His pure hatred for the Tyrannical Dictator, Stalin, fuels his passion to write this letter. He's RUINED the good name of Communism while chasing his only goal, power. The atrocities he's committed in order to keep his unstable regime from falling apart are completely unforgivable. All of these thoughts swirl around Jay Lovestone's mind as he furiously writes and finishes this letter."

 new_york.42.d: "What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Qaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

 new_york.45.d: "Before the trail, Herbert H. Lehman hired the best lawyer he could find. This lawyer fought valiantly. Both sides brought forward evidence that could leave either Herbert or Charles in Jail, both would argue that all this \"evidence\" was falsified. However, Charles was able to uncover enough evidence before the trail to secure the outcome before it even began. After days of debate, Herbert H. Lehman has been found guilty of corruption, conspiring against the state, and undermining democracy in New York State. Herbert H. Lehman is impeached, Charles Poletti can now easily take power in New York."

 new_york.46.d: "Before the trail, Herbert H. Lehman hired the best lawyer he could find. This lawyer fought valiantly. Both sides brought forward evidence that could leave either Herbert or Charles in Jail, both would argue that all this \"evidence\" was falsified. Despite Charles' efforts, the outcome was not certain. With days of debate coming and going, it was clear this trail would have to come to a close eventually. In the end, it was found there wasn't enough evidence to impeach Herbert H. Lehman. Lehman was found innocent and Charles Lehman must find another way to save New York State."
 new_york.46.a: "We must find Another Way!"
  
 new_york.47.t: "The Unthinkable Option"
 new_york.47.d: "With the failure of the Impeachment Trail, many people in New York are left disappointed. Charles is furious. He knows that Herbert H. Lehman has done numerous things that are worthy of impeachment, but he just wasn't able to execute everything perfectly. Leaving the people to suffer any longer under Lehman's rule is completely out of the Question. Charles is left with only one option left, he must forcefully restore democracy to New York! Either he must lead a rebellion personally, or perhaps he can bring back a familiar face. If the impeachment trail of Lehman was rigged, then surely Franklin D. Roosevelts was too! FDR could be the man to finally unite New York once again!"

 new_york.48.d: "\"Mr. Roosevelt, I'm writing to you today in our country's darkest hour. The current president Herbert H. Lehman has brought shame to New York and has cancelled the election to further his own interests. I have, unfortunately been unable to remove him peacefully. While New York may have dishonored you and your name in the sake of keeping the peace with New York City, it is clear to me now that trial was staged - you were positioned to be impeached from the beginning. I hope you may be able to find it within yourself to come back and reclaim your rightful place as the leader of New York.\"\n\nBest wishes XOXO, -Charles Poletti"

 new_york.52.t: "Blame Lehman of Rigging the Trail"
 new_york.52.d: "With the amount of evidence piled up against Herbert H. Lehman, it seems impossible that he lost his impeachment trail. There is only one reasonable explanation for how he wasn't impeached, Herbert H. Lehman must've rigged the trail! The evidence Charles' uncovered shows that Lehman is no stranger to corruption, bribes, and backdoor dealings. It is not so far of an assumption that he bribed all those involved and rigged the trail in his favor, in fact it is the only plausible explanation!"

 new_york.53.t: "Franklin D. Roosevelt Meets with his Supporters in Congress"
 new_york.53.d: "Even after his impeachment, FDR has nearly half of those in Congress still loyal to him and his ideology. After merely showing back up in New York State, the whole country felt stability start to come back to it. It is like a father finally coming back home after being gone for years. Congress has immediately pulled all of it support behind Franklin D. Roosevelt and his rebellion against the tyranny that Herbert H. Lehman has caused."

I would like to inform the people of New York that all of these threats and rumors have been investigated thoroughly, and we have found them to be merely false threats. Rumors spread farther than they ever had any right to exist. There is no so-called 'rebellion' and anyone who thinks so is foolish.\" Without Charles Poletti helping him out with everything, it seems Herbert H. Lehman isn't entirely capable to even ensure the stability of the state. No matter, it only makes our jobs easier."

 new_york.55.d: "After many months of preparation, the forces in favor of democracy to return to New York are finally ready to rebel. Herbert H.

 new_york.58.d: "Behind the public eye, as to not come off as a hypocrite, Charles Poletti meets with Vito Genovese and Lucky Luciano. Both of these men are Italian-blooded mafia from New York State and know Charles Poletti to some degree. They have been in hiding since the collapse of the United States, able to evade the authority of any newly established government in the region. Thank to the collapse, the records of their crimes are spotty at best. A deal was worked out between these two men and Charles Poletti. In exchange for their help in personal and state matters, Charles Poletti will clear their name without making any of this public knowledge."

 new_york.59.t: "Franklin D. Roosevelt Confronts Us."
 new_york.59.d: "When the Union was collapsing, New York State under Franklin D. Roosevelt held firm with it's commitment to the United States. In contrast, we saw the writing on the wall, the Union was no longer United, it could not stay together. At the end of 1932, on New Jersey and New York remained in the Union and Hoover's \"Unity Through Peace\" policy had proven ineffective in keeping the Union together. New Jersey and Herbert Hoover in D.C. planned to retake Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia by force. With Federal Forces marching into Wilmington, we - lead by Fiorello La Guardia - increased our pressure for New York State to leave the Union, we were prepared to use force if needed. With the populous of New York State already not supporting the war initiative, it was easy to impeach Franklin D. Roosevelt and end any illusion of New York still supporting the Union.\n\n With Franklin D. Roosevelt back in office, he is confronting us about the impeachment, he believes it was unjustified and calls for an apology and reintegration into a greater New York State once again."

 new_york.62.d: "Stepping into New York City for the first time in years, Franklin D. Roosevelt takes in all the sights. The tall buildings filled with hundreds of people are a rare spectacle in the remnants of the once prosperous United States. Rolling across the Brooklyn Bridge, Franklin D. Roosevelt talks with all those commuting to work and traveling to shops. Millions of people live in this one city, when some entire countries barely have a single million! The Statue of Liberty is another one of the many amazing sights that New York City holds. The people happily greet Franklin D. Roosevelt, no hard feelings seem to remain."

 new_york.64.d: "\"Batter Up!\" Franklin D. Roosevelt rolled up to the plate. It was him and New York's best team versus [NYC.GetLeader] and New York City's best team. Despite the fact he's confined to a wheelchair, Franklin D. Roosevelt insisted on participating in this event. After FDR Served the first pitch, [NYC.GetLeader] swung violently at it, knowing that the fate of New York City lay in his hands. He swung too early and the ball flew out of bounds. Pitching again, FDR gave this ball a spin. Thrown off by the spin, [NYC.GetLeader] - his inexperience showing - swung at the ball and completely missed it. With one more pitch, [NYC.GetLeader] got a strikeout. Even with [NYC.GetLeader]'s inexperience with baseball, the team he was able to assemble for this bout was able to put up an exciting fight against Franklin D. Roosevelt and his team. Ending in a score of 12-10 in Franklin D. Roosevelt's favor, this baseball game would go down in history as the one that determined the fate of New York City"

 new_york.65.d: "The rolling of Franklin D. Roosevelt wheelchair's wheels can be heard throughout the ring. Gathered in a boxing ring in New York City is a crowd of many thousands of people, eager to see this match. [NYC.GetLeader] stands in his corner of the ring, waiting for FDR to roll in. Using a custom built ramp for this fight, FDR finally gets in the ring, wheelchair and all. Dawning the \"Gloves of Democracy\" Franklin D. Roosevelt readies himself for the fight. The referee calls the fight to begin. Taking the first swing, [NYC.GetLeader] throws a strong right hook at FDR. Ducking his head down, FDR dodges the attack, in return he gut punches [NYC.GetLeader]. Being brought back a few steps, [NYC.GetLeader] recomposes himself while FDR sits in his wheelchair, unable to follow up the counterattack. Smiling, [NYC.GetLeader] has realized this weakness of FDR - he can't go on the offensive, \"You can't fight, you damned fool! How do you expect to win when all you can do is take punches!?\"\nFranklin D. Roosevelt responds, \"That's what you think\". Grabbing onto his wheelchair's rims with his gloved hands, he using all his strength to propel himself forward. Before [NYC.GetLeader] can react, FDR uses this momentum to make a left gut punch even more devastating. After Franklin D. Roosevelt was able to turn his disadvantage into an advantage, he was able to overcome [NYC.GetLeader] and beat him in the boxing match. He has shown is prowess in the ring."

[SNY.GetLeader] has listened to their pleas. Life in the newly independent New York State has been much more turbulent than the Old Union ever offered. The American Civil War, The War for American Independence, and the War of 1812. All of these wars were relatively stable compared to the questionable times we find ourselves faced with, and all these time periods in American History have been fetichized by many. The calls for Unionization have become louder as the years continue. We have learned from the mistakes of the old Union, we have learned from the mistakes of Herbert Hoover, and we have learned from the mistakes of independence. We must reach out to Federalist Strongholds and create a more perfect union. Not through conquest, but through Unity and Brotherhood."

 new_york.69.d: "New York stands as one of the few examples of true democracy left in the Disunited States. Personality cults, crazed governors thirsting for power, oligarchies and pseudo-oligarchies forcing their influence over the masses, and blatant dictators. None of these belong in a world protected and defended by democracy. Yet, there is no protector and defender of democracy to protect the civil liberties and freedoms of the many diverse people of North America. We must rise above the chaos plaguing North America and become that defender. We must become a bastion, a shining torch, of democracy warming the hearts of the people and melting the oppression that has left an otherwise permanent stain on North America."

While this move may be seen as hypocritical, Charles has deemed it necessary to do his own backdoor dealings in order to expose Herbert H. Lehman's corruption. Being told to hide from the public eye, the Mafia has broken into Lehman's personal offices late at night. Shuffling through files and personally pocketing any loose change they find, they find anything that could incriminate Lehman or could otherwise help win the trail.

 new_york.84.d: "North America isn't the only part of the world that has suffered through the early 20th century. Following an extended, and unnecessary, occupation of the Ruhr, relations between The United Kingdom and France began to break down. Aligning themselves with their former enemy, Germany, The United Kingdom protested France's expanding influence in Europe. In 1931, tension reached a tipping point and war broke out with The United Kingdom and Germany on one side and France and Italy on the other side. Quickly, countries began joining both sides of the war. Being the leading great power in the world, The United Kingdom was the main fighting force in the Allies. German industry was still struggling to recover after the aftermath of The First World War. Supplied by The British, Germany took defensive positions in Europe as The United Kingdom focused their attention on Africa and Asia. They were able to clear France and Italy out of most of Africa except the Mediterranean coastline, where some French outposts still hold strong. In Asia, they faced much opposition against Japan, who joined the war on the side of the French after the Netherlands joined the Allies. Asia proved to be one of the most important fronts for the British, however. The British Raj supplied much needed manpower to both Germany and The United Kingdom and the resources from South East Asia gave The United Kingdom and Germany a resource advantage over the Entente side. It would be best to focus on manpower - well trained troops - when supporting the Allies in this Second World War. The British Industry is one of the largest industrial bases in the world and Germany's industry continues to rebuild as the war goes on. With more manpower, their main disadvantage can be removed and we can expect the Allies to win."
 new_york.84.a: "Interesting"
  
 new_york.85.t: "French/Italo/Soviet Side of the War."
 new_york.85.d: "Although an unlikely alliance of countries, they are united in their goal to take down The United Kingdom and Germany. Only half a decade before World War II, Italy found itself lead by Mussolini after a Fascist Revolution. Leading up to the war, France expanded her continental ambition, attempting to ensure their top spot in Europe and to forever ruin Germany. The United Kingdom did not support France's new ambitions and put their backing behind Germany. Seeking an ally in Europe, France reached out to Italy because of their natural distrust of The United Kingdom. This uneasy peace couldn't last, and eventually tensions reached a tipping point in 1931. War broke out between the Allies and the Entente. With Germany still being severely crippled due to The First World War and the Treaty of Versailles, France and Italy knew that their goal should be isolating and crippling The United Kingdom, their main threat. With their \"eventual\" victory in this war, France planned to carve up Europe to serve themselves and their allies. Needing another ally, France reached out to the fledgling Soviet Union, promising them much of Eastern Europe if they helped take out Germany and isolate The United Kingdom. Only a couple of years after the start of the war, The Soviet Union joined on the Entente. Marching through Poland, who joined the Allies, the Soviets meet the forces of Germany and Poland with British support along the Vistula River. Germany was never the Soviet's main focus, as they diverted almost half of their army to secure the Balkans and Finland in the early days of the war. This gave Germany time to build defenses, and the Entente lost their only chance to come through with an easy victory against the Allies. Japan joined France against the Allies for similar reasons, the promise of land in the Dutch East Indies (and the \"eventual\" concession of French Indochina). France fell to a Fascist revolution, similar to Italy, during the war. This Fascist French party invested even more into the war effort, in an attempt to close the technological, industrial, and resource gap between them and the Allies. While manpower is plentiful for the Entente, if we are to support them effectively it will be with advanced weaponry. With advanced weaponry, their main disadvantage can be removed and we can expect the Entente to win."
  
 new_york.86.t: "Japan Backs Down"
 new_york.86.d: "Following the end of The First World War, Japan has expanded their influence throughout the Pacific Ocean. Initially, we were one of the few nations putting pressure on them to stop their aggressive expansion. However, after The Union collapsed, Japan began unchecked expansion throughout the Pacific Ocean. While the West Coast of North America still remains mostly unaffected, mostly thanks to Japan's involvement in The Second World War, we needed to put a check on their expansion.\n\nJapan has responded to our threat. Seeing our quickly rebuilding navy and army, they have decided to back down on their imperial ambitions. They have already renounced any claim they may have had in North America, but that is not enough. We must undermine their new empire and free the people the Japanese have subjugated in the years we have been absent in this World Stage."

They have called our threat a bluff. Despite our massively growing navy and military, they still assert all of their imperial claims across the Pacific Ocean and the West Coast of America. Japan has seemed to have lost all respect that had for our mighty nation. We must put them back in their place."

With the numerous number of unhappy Chinese under Japanese rule, there were plenty of groups to supply with weapons. They have the manpower, and we have the weapons.\n\nWith the influx of weapons we gave them, Chinese Insurgents have begun retaking their homeland.

While finding initial success, Japan has crushed our armed rebellions. Despite this, we know that the fight of the Chinese will not end. One day they will achieve independence once again and we will be at the peace table to tear Japan's Imperial Empire apart."

The United Kingdom retained a stronghold in Singapore and Malaya to ensure the flow of oil and rubber remains sufficient for their war efforts. However, much of Indonesia has found itself under Japanese Oppression.\n\nAfter giving these Indonesian resistance groups weapons to fight back against the Japanese, they have found immediate success. The island of Java has been liberated from Japanese rule with Borneo and most other major Indonesian Islands having rebels. With their victories, British support has also begun flowing towards the Indonesians, just as long as they ensure the oil and rubber keeps flowing to fund the war in Europe."

The Democratic Party has blundered and we have to pay for their mistakes. It is we who have to suffer the human loss. It is we who will have to bear the taxpayer dollars to repair the damage. And it is we who has the power to make sure the government never makes such a mistake again. I would not be so foolish to say that it is merely because of the Democratic Party that New York regressed to such a state, but it is the ignorance and the overstepping of the influence of the government. That is why you all should vote Republican! For Limited Government! For Free Trade! And to Avoid Another Albany Attack!\""

The Albany Attack has finally shown the inefficiency of Democracy and the corruption corruption that inevitably comes with it. To think that William F. Bleakley will run this country any better than Herbert Lehman is a fool's thought. They both hail from an inherently corrupt system. Democracy should only act as a vehicle to reach other, better, systems of governance.

 new_york.107.dc: "Following an unlikely turn of events, and a powerful speech, Robert Minor and the Communist Party has shaken the democratic system at its core and replaced The Democratic Party as one of the two main contenders for the President of New York State.

 new_york.107.dd: "Still recovering from the Shock of the Albany Attack, no party or candidate took to the stands to make a speech. Despite the lack of a speech, the people have still found someone to latch on to. William F.
