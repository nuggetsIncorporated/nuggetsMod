  NIC_Sandinista_Insurrection_desc:0 "Since 1927 former liberal turned Communist guerrilla leader Augusto César Sandino has personally led a band of guerrillas waging war against our government. The insurrection is not likely to end soon as the first peace negotiations failed due to the National Guard attacking the cease fire meeting held by Sacasa."
