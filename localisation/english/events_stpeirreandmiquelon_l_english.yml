    stpandm.1.t:0 "Our Future"
    stpandm.1.d:0 "Our humble island has been forgotten and essentially abandoned since the beginning of the Second Great War. Our once peaceful island community has been encroached on by the flames of the global conflict currently ongoing. The French government in Paris saw no value in properly defending Saint Pierre & Miquelon and thus left us to our fate, being defenseless we were an easy picking for a brief British occupation in 1934. It was a humiliating disgrace to our proud islanders who now feel neglected by the central government, even after the British left the island it still implanted a bitter atmosphere and a rift between the island and Metropolitan France grew larger. After the French abandoned us we have essentially gained de-facto independence, albeit with no foreseeable" future, without foreign support our island is defenseless and now our people have grown to distrust the government of France. Our future is at a crossroads of seeking out to repair our  Mainland French relationship or going our own way and to grow more connected with the Canadian provinces."
