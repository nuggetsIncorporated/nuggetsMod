north_carolina.1.d:0 "Hoey has recently formed the Southern Defense Council, and has given us a formal invite to join, shall we do it?"
north_carolina.1.a:0 "We used to be united, and we shall be once again!"
north_carolina.1.b:0 "Tell him no thanks"

north_carolina.2.t:0 "Carolinian Cooperation"
north_carolina.2.d:0 "Hoey has decided to form the Southern Defense Council, and the first and most obvious member of it would be our southern neighbor, South Carolina."
north_carolina.2.a:0 "An important first step"
north_carolina.2.b:0 "We'd rather go it alone"

north_carolina.3.t:0 "Virginian Cooperation"
north_carolina.3.d:0 "Hoey has recently formed the Southern Defense Council, and has given us a formal invite to join, shall we do it?"
north_carolina.3.a:0 "Of course we'll join, we are stronger together!"
north_carolina.3.a:0 "Tell him no thanks"

north_carolina.4.t:0 "The 1936 Elections"
north_carolina.4.d:0 "With another four years having passed since the last (and truly final) American election, the people of North Carolina have decided to continue the tradition of 4-year terms and are now looking to elect a new leader. The candidates are as follows; Clyde R. Hoey, a former North Carolina Representative who is running with the Democratic Party; William Dudley Pelley, an author from Massachusetts who resides in Asheville and is running with the self-proclaimed Silver Legion of America; and Paul Crouch, an activist and former soldier who is running with the Communist Party."
north_carolina.4.a:0 "Let's stay with the Democrats; elect Hoey!"
north_carolina.4.b:0 "Pelley seems eccentric... we like it!"

north_carolina.5.t:0 "Pelley wants to Join Us"
north_carolina.5.d:0 "The Fascist Dictator of North Carolina has called on us to allow him into our merry band of Populists. Pelley is known across the country for his anti-semitism and religious extremism. The man rose only recently, inspired by Mussolini and other European dictators. While him and his Silvershirts don't share all our values, they do hate communism. On top of that they are political outsiders who are rather disliked by the North-Eastern Elite. North Carolina is a powerhouse for sure, with them in the Jeffersonian League the South will be ours. But at what price?"
north_carolina.5.a:0 "The More the Better!"
north_carolina.5.b:0  "He's a nutjob, no way! "

north_carolina.6.t:0 "J. Melville Broughton Inauguration"
north_carolina.6.d:0 "After winning last year's general election, Governor Elect Broughton will take office today as North Carolina's 60th Governor. Broughton is a reformer, but is unlikely to drastically change the state one way or the other."
north_carolina.6.a:0 "Cool!"

north_carolina.7.t:0 "North Carolina wants to join the League"
north_carolina.7.d:0 "North Carolina recently has adopted the Share the Wealth program and has even given us credit for the idea. The nation now seeks membership in the Jeffersonian League. We have little reason not to let them in. At this point they may overshadow us within our own faction, but even then we hold the reigns over Oklahoma. Likely we can work together."
north_carolina.7.a:0 "The More the Merrier!"
north_carolina.7.b:0  "No way!"

north_carolina.8.t:0 "North Carolina Elects Fascist Pelley"
north_carolina.8.d:0 "After a close election, William Dudley Pelley has won the Governor's election of North Carolina. Pelley is the leader of the fascist Silver Legion, a group of rough right-wingers who push a policy of White Christian-only welfare statism. Pelley is known for his oddball beliefs like a supposed out-of-body experience and extreme dislike of Jews. Pelley won the Governorship campaigning on his welfare program and claiming Democrats could never get them out of the Depression. Pelley claims he will build a strong centralized state to pull NC out of the depression. We now must decide how to act when such a unpredictable and dangerous leader coming to power in our neighbor republic. The Silvershirts have almost no presence in South Carolina but that could change with this madman coming to power. Denouncing him could help North Carolina Democrats rally to defeat his extreme agenda."
north_carolina.8.a:0 "Condemn Pelley and his Silvershirts"
north_carolina.8.b:0 "Better to Ignore Pelley"


north_carolina.9.t:0 "South Carolina Governor Johnston Condemns Pelley"
north_carolina.9.d:0 "South Carolina’s Governor Olin Johnston has condemned newly elected Governor Pelley as a 'deranged  bigoted hack'. He has claimed that North Carolinians must 'stand up against the Carpet Bagger Fascist  pretending to be a Christian'. In his speech in front of the South Carolina General Assembly, he read out his report on Pelleys past actions and writings.  Johnston was met by a large applause when he finished his speech. Many textile workers in the Carolinas Appalachia look up to Johnston and thus this attack is damaging. However, as it stands attacking a strong incumbent while we have yet to pass legislation could prove too dangerous. We should wait for the right opportunity to strike back at Johnston and his state."
north_carolina.9.a:0 "We will look for Revenge Sooner than Later..."

north_carolina.10.t:0 "Silver Legion Seek Permission to March in South Carolina"
north_carolina.10.d:0 "Our loyal Silvershirts seek permission to have a march through Spartanburg in South Carolina. This will be the first Silver Legion event in the Palmetto state and is being pressed by our Silvershirt squad leaders as payback for Governor Johnston's cowardly attacks on our great leader. This rally will show we do not fear that dark souled Governor especially since Spartanburg is home city. However, some of our new Democrat allies in Raleigh urge that we stop them from marching to avoid a conflict with South Carolina. Ultimately it is up to our great Leader to decide. "
north_carolina.10.a:0 "March Onwards Christian Soilders"
north_carolina.10.b:0 "No, way this could start a War"

north_carolina.11.t:0 "Silver Shirts March Through Spartanburg"
north_carolina.11.d:0 "A Silver Shirt column from Asheville North Carolina marched through Johnstons hometown of Spartanburg today. As they marched local textile workers began pelting them with bottles and trash. Within a few minutes, shots rang out and men began to fight. Spartanburg natives and Ashville Silver Shirts fought in the street with at least two textile mill workers dying with numerous people being injured. In the aftermath, local Spartanburg police arrested a hundred Silvershirts with charges of rioting and illegal entering South Carolina. "
north_carolina.11.a:0 "Let them Rot!"


north_carolina.12.t:0 "Silver Shirts Arrested in South Carolina"
north_carolina.12.d:0 "A Silver Shirt column from Asheville North Carolina marched through Johnstons hometown of Spartanburg today. As they marched local textile workers began pelting them with bottles and trash. Within a few minutes, shots rang out and men began to fight. Spartanburg natives and Ashville Silver Shirts fought in the street with at least two textile mill workers dying with numerous people being injured. In the aftermath, local Spartanburg police arrested a hundred Silvershirts with charges of rioting and illegal entering South Carolina. Now we must decide on what to do with our men being locked in South Carolina jails. Many of our Silvershirts demand we march into the Palmetto state and free them then move straight into Columbia in a glorious conquest. However, the Democrats and many people in the state fear this would be a disastrous move. We could make an ultimatum for their release or war but once made we cannot back down."
north_carolina.12.a:0 "He will release them or War"
north_carolina.12.b:0 "We cannot afford a War this early"



north_carolina.20.t:0 "Pelley Demands Silver Shirts Be Let Free or Else"
north_carolina.11.d:0 "Governor Pelley has demanded his Silvershirts be set free or else he will take military action to free them.  This has come as a shock to the Democrat leadership of our state but there also is a stern defiance. Across the board, they have promised to support us as Governor if we stand against Pelley. However,  our General staff claim we aren’t ready for a war with the more industrialized and populous North Carolina. A war could quickly end with our defeat and they are secretly pleading that we release the prisoners. Its up to Machine Gun Olin to decide.  All blame and glory will rest on him. "
north_carolina.11.a:0 "We will not let this Tyrant tell us what to do."
north_carolina.11.b:0 "Peace must be kept, release them all."

north_carolina.21.t:0 "South Carolina Defies Us"
north_carolina.21.d:0 "Governor Johnston delievered a agressive speech to the South Carolina General Assembly this morning declaring he will not yeild a inch to the 'heretical Silver tongue tyrant from the North'. We now have no choice but to quickly strike. Silvershirts and the army will march into South Carolina with all haste."
north_carolina.21.a:0 "To War!"



north_carolina.23.t:0 "Governor Johnston Releases Prisoners"
north_carolina.23.d:0 "In a embarrassing geo-political act of weakness Governor of South Carolina has pardoned all Silvershirt prisoners and had the Spartanburg police drive them across the state border at full speed. All 100 Silvershirts marched into Ashville with a hero's welcome. Such a victory has had many relieved and wondering how Pelley has managed to scare the once gallant state of South Carolina who once dared to fire on Fort Sumter. Even more conservative Democrats are impressed and wonder if the liberal Johnston isn’t so tough after all. In short Pelley has scored his first geo-political success."
north_carolina.23.a:0 "South Carolina must be weak!"



north_carolina.50.t:0 "A Night of Terror"
north_carolina.50.d:0 "Late last night, screams of terror could be heard as thousands of Silver Shirts marched throughout the streets of Raleigh, attacking anyone who had connections to The Union of Comrades, a communist and fiercely anti-Pelley organization. While demonstrations throughout the city had been occurring regularly since Pelley's victory in the election, they had never been seen on this magnitude. Anyone who was outside at the time was a potential target, with demonstrators brutally beating, mugging, and in some cases executing suspected 'Hoeyists' as they called them. When news reached Pelley about the riots, he hesitated to call for action, only doing so after hearing an explosion not too far from where he was staying. After all was said and done, 13 were killed, with countless more injured and millions of dollars in damage."
north_carolina.50.a:0 "They had it coming!"

north_carolina.51.t:0 "Pelley's Speech"
north_carolina.51.d:0 "There is no time more important in our young nation's history than right now, for we have the chance to become something great, something that our ancestors would be proud of. We can achieve a level of glory that most can only ever dream of. To do it though, will require each and every one of you to put in your share of the work, for nothing short of your hardest will suffice. We must first focus on ourselves, purifying the state of any imperfections and imposing the teachings of Jesus Christ among all the people of our great nation! Once we are pure, we must work on creating a fighting force so strong that nobody would dare to oppose it! Finally, we will lead a brilliant and quick campaign against our enemies, restoring Southern glory! Only then shall we have achieved greatness!"
north_carolina.51.a:0 "Lets get to work!"

north_carolina.52.t:0 "Rooting Out Our Imperfections"
north_carolina.52.d:0 "The Jewish race and their Judeo-Bolshevik allies must pay! Our society's only imperfections are the vile outcasts of society that haven't been hunted down yet. It is time to call upon our entire White populace to rally and vanquish these last vestiges of the old decadent carpetbagger order!"
north_carolina.52.a:0 "Damn them!"

north_carolina.53.t:0 "North Carolina Approaches Us"
north_carolina.53.d:0 "The Longist aligned government of North Carolina approached our government today with diplomatic offers and invitations. We could join North Carolina's faction and keep a tight knit cultural bond between the two of our states for future cooperation. On the other hand, some in our government are skeptical about how sincere North Carolina is when it comes to maintaining our independence."
north_carolina.53.a:0 "We should join this alliance!"
north_carolina.53.b:0 "Never! South Carolina doesn't bow to tyrants."

north_carolina.54.t:0 "North Carolinian Offer"

north_carolina.54.b:0 "We don't need out of state individuals dictating what we do!"
