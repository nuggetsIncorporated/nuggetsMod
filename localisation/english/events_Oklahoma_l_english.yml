    oklahoma.1.t:0 "The Red River Incident"
    oklahoma.1.d:0 "Earlier this week, a Texan fisherman was found on the wrong side of the Red River, on our side. While we would have normally escorted him back to Texas, the National Guard Soldier stationed near the area believed that it wasn't actually a fisherman who crossed, but rather a Texan Soldier. Because of this mistake, he shot the fisherman - killing him instantly. \n\n The National Guard Soldier defends himself stating that the light blanket of fog that surrounded the river that day impaired his judgement and that he didn't want to take any chances. \n\n Texas believes that this incident is enough to warrant war with Oklahoma. This statement does not seem to merely an empty threat as many National Guard Soldiers stationed on the border noticed the Texan border Guard growing in size day by day, to the point where many fear that Texas is planning and prepared to invade Oklahoma within just a couple of weeks. \n\n Many of the higher ups in the country wish to call on Louisiana for aid in protecting our country."
