  POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_DESC:0 "'The Man who destroyed America' is what many would refer to Hoover after his infamous presidency and failure to maintaining the decades old experiment that was the United States. From a humble man to a rich humanitarian to now a sad man who sits in the empty white house. His last attempt to repair the United States only distanced the shell of D.C away from the rest of the Union. It has been 6 years since the collapse and now Hoover has now began to try another attempt at restoring the United States. Rallying the few remaining members of his government, Hoover plans for another strike at Maryland. While the D.C public still has faith in Hoover despite all the failures, their forgiving nature is running low. But Hoover has a plan and if succeded may be the step in the right direction to restoring his legacy and restoring the United States. If not, well Hoover certainly has nothing left to lose but an empty house and his few funds remaining."

  POLITICS_SAD_HOOVER_DESC:0 "'We won but at what cost?' Hoover may have managed his gamble of retaking a large portion of former United States land however he has decentralized the Federal Government to an insane degree, now being a weak confedration. Hoover has now been smoking and drinking all the regrets away in the White House while the protesters rally against him for remaining a dictator. The Confederation was a mistake that was brought back by him to remain in power only to make things worse. But hey atleast there is still a United States somewhere in that Confederal mess."
