    newjersey.1.t: "A Fracturing Union" 
    newjersey.1.d: "By late 1932 the situation in America was becoming increasingly desperate. The Hoover administration's lackluster policy of 'Unity Through Peace' had allowed almost all the states west of the Mississippi to secede by the end of 31' without any obstruction whatsoever. By the end of November in 32', we and Washington D.C. were the last strongholds of the union in the Atlantic. It was clear that if there was any hope left of saving the union, doing it through peaceful means were entirely out of the question. In early December a plan to occupy Delaware, and eventually retake several key states was hastily drafted on the order of Governor Harry Moore, which was then presented to Hoover and his cabinet. Although reluctant, Hoover agreed, and on December 25th our forces marched into Wilmington..."
    newjersey.1.a: "What happens next?"

    newjersey.2.t: "The Great Catastrophe" 
    newjersey.2.d: "When we entered Delaware, our troops faced little resistance on account of the holiday. By the first week of January we had captured all of Delaware while forces in D.C. were making their way to Baltimore. The first stage of our grand plan to retake the union was going well until Governor Moore, in all of his arrogance, demanded that New Jersey have her state border moved to the Susquehanna River, which would swallow all of Delaware and a 1/3 of Maryland. Hoover dismissed the idea, saying that it was not relevant to the matter at hand, however Moore would not let go so easily. After D.C. forces failed to take Baltimore, Hoover called on our military to march into Maryland, which Moore, refusing to swallow his pride, refused. Without our help and Virginia joining the conflict, Hoover's forces were pushed back to D.C., being relegated to a city state. After squashing D.C., the combined forces of Maryland and Virginia pushed us out of Delaware, with our forces narrowly escaping total antihalation through Pennsylvania. After the defeat in Delaware, Moore signed a peace pact with our enemies, promising to disarm our forces and become an ally to them. Our army would not let Moore's actions go unpunished, and on March 13th, they bravely led a coup against Governor Moore, promising to take revenge..."

    newjersey.7.a: "Hurrah!"

    newjersey.8.t: "New Jersey Strikes!" 
    newjersey.8.d: "Disturbing reports have come in this morning stating New Jersey forces have landed in the town of Lewes, Delaware, and have captured the surrounding area! Our intelligence reports tell us that only a few thousand ill-equipped men have landed, yet in New Jersey these landings are being hailed as the rebirth of the Union!"
    newjersey.8.a: "What a joke! Send those fools an ultimatum!"

    newjersey.9.t: "Maryland Sends Us an Ultimatum!" 
    newjersey.9.d: "We've received an ultimatum, written by the Governor of Maryland himself, telling us to withdraw our forces or face total annihilation. He insists that we stand no chance, and this will only serve to hurt both of our nations. He went on to say that what happened in 33' should be left in the past, and that we should work with eachother, not against. What he does not understand is that this isn't about revenge, its about keeping America alive! In the closing part of the letter, he wrote: 'It's over Schwarzkopf, I have the advantage!'"
    newjersey.9.a: "You underestimate my power!"

    newjersey.10.t: "Our Marines Are Out of Place!" 
    newjersey.10.d: "It is essential that our marines are based in Cape May! It is impossible to plan an assult when the divisions performing it aren't on the planning grounds. We will not be able to continue planning until they are back at Cape May!"
    newjersey.10.a: "We will move them back immediately!"

    newjersey.11.t: "We Have Been Bested!" 
    newjersey.11.d: "Despite our best efforts, those Jersey bastards have pushed us across the Susquehanna River! While some high ranking army officials think that we could continue the war and push those Jersey bastards into the sea, the civilian population sees it differently, a lost cause in their minds. It is widely understood that New Jersey only seeks the Delmarva Peninsula, and while it would be a devastating loss without a doubt, we would still keep our major cities and independence. If they were to reject this reasonable offer, our friends in Richmond would surely come to our aid..."
    newjersey.11.a: "The war is lost, send those bastards an offer!"
    newjersey.11.b: "We will drive them from our lands!"

        #In a speech made by the violently anti-war group, The Poppy Party, a man was quoted as saying: 'Factories have been leveled, homes have been destroyed, and families have been decimated, and this government keeps on letting it happen! Enough is enough, we must forgo our pride and realize we have lost this war! We must realize that we can still lose our Maryland! We must realize that we can still lose our lives! We must realize that we have to end this while we still can!' which many commoners have agreed with. 

    newjersey.12.t: "Maryland Admits Defeat!" 
    newjersey.12.d: "After 3 long years, our hard work has finally paid off! We have received an offer from the cowards in Annapolis promising us all of the Delmarva Peninsula in exchange for peace! While an overwhelming majority call for us to accept this offer, there are those who wish to continue on, and finish these dogs off! This would be the ideal option, however Virginia has made it clear that going any further into Maryland will result in a full-scale war with them, something which we surely can't afford!"
    newjersey.12.a: "This will suffice, for now..."
    newjersey.12.b: "This war is not over until we have achieved total victory!"

    newjersey.13.t: "New Jersey Refuses Peace!" 
    newjersey.13.d: "New Jersey has rejected Maryland's offer of peace, and have declared that they intend to march all the way down to Annapolis! If this were to come to fruition, it would surely upset the balance of power in the region, and there is no doubt in our minds that those bastards would come for use next!"
    newjersey.13.a: "We defeated those bastards once, and we shall once again!"
    newjersey.13.b: "Leave Maryland to their fate!"

    newjersey.15.t: "The Government Has Been Coup'd!" 
    newjersey.15.d: "'The Union died 4 long years ago, and it has taken 2 failed invasions of our neighbors by a tyrannical government to prove this truth! We have lost family, we have lost our jobs, we have lost our dignity under this government! If this government follows American principles and values, it should know that governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. This government has lost our consent! We the people must install a new one, governed by the people!' rang out from radios all across New Jersey today, shortly before an irate mob stormed the capital in Trenton. Facing an overwhelming crowd, the military and police did not put up a fight, and the government was overthrown! We have much work ahead of us to fix this broken nation, but after 4 years the healing process can begin"

    newjersey.30.d: "The importance of a capital city for any nation cannot be understated. It serves as the location for central government meetings and offices. The capital is home to many of a country's leaders, embassies, and officials that work there. The United States has had many capitals over the years in many states, including New Jersey. Now that we control many of these spots and are beginning to grow, we should settle on a permanent spot to have our capital..."

    newjersey.32.d: "It has been many years since this once great nation crumbled to ashes. But do not give up hope, for Americans never quit! Those ashes have started a new fire burning inside of every patriot's heart! We will use this fire to burn our enemies to the ground and rebuild our once great nation! I come here today to present a plan on how we ought to go about about doing this, and the answer is clear. Looking to our North and West, we are surrounded by states that are equal in strength and size of our own, anything but a stalemate between these traitors is impossible. If we wish to deliver freedom we must strike the soft underbelly of America! The states down in Dixie are ripe for the picking, and picking we will do! Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, all lack the means to oppose our liberation! We will take back Dixie! We we will succeed! We will return to the America we knew not so long ago!"

    newjersey.34.b: "MacArthur is right, go for America's soft underbelly!"
    newjersey.34.c: "The Heart of America we cannot go without, we pick Eisenhower!"
    newjersey.34.d: "Read me back the transcripts, I can't decide!"

    newjersey.35.t: "The Canadian Situation"
    newjersey.35.d: "Following the collapse of America, the Canadians saw a similar collapse of their own, as mass protests and demonstrations forced the government to retreat back to Ontario. Like down in the states there are inter-provincial conflicts as well, with Ontario and Quebec facing off as to who will be the dominant power in the East. This has presented us with two choices; to help stabilize the region or capitalize on their divide. Having friends up North could serve to benefit us greatly, however it would also mean we would be entangled in their conflicts, as well as ours, something we may want to avoid. That would leave us with the option of simply invading smaller provinces, though this would certainly alienate us from the entirety of Canada, something we may also want to avoid"
    newjersey.35.a: "Tough choice, but it is one we must make"

    newjersey.45.d: "Those fanatics in New Jersey are now eying down Dixie as their target for so called 'liberation.' We've already seen what work we've they've done of Virginia and North Carolina, and it's clear that South Carolina is their next target, then us after that. Many Southern leaders are calling for unity against the Yankee menace, but none have taken it further than that. Should we form a coalition?"

    newjersey.52.d: "Tennessee has not outright said no to our request, but has instead insisted that they get something out of it, that being land. Specifically they were asking for parts of the Deep South and Gulf Coast. Some officials have called the demand a 'blessing in disguise,' insisting that those regions are worthless and not even worth the price of occupation. Others have said however that those regions offer enormous industrial potential, and are an integral part of America."

Why are the Northerners trying to take our great Dixie away from us? For a nation so pressed on the idea of democracy and self determination, I ask, why must they use deadly force to control their citizens?
