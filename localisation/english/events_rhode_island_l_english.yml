Lovecraft held a speech to crowd of people proclaiming Rhode Island's government a failure for being far too weak to govern and that they step down in this election.

However it was clear the writing on the wall was that the United States had failed. Soon as we left the other states followed. But now we face a great issue on our hands as Worker's all over the state have had enough and a huge string of strikes had began. Our government couldn't end them without a great upset in the party and government. It is now 1936 and the situation has enflamed the state being the leading issue. There is a plan to create a Democratic majority in Rhode Island again, however it will have to be until after the election. For now Theodore must make do until then"

    rhode_island.10.a: "Let's Get Back On Track"

    rhode_island.11.t: "Our Position"
    rhode_island.11.d: "Our nation was one of the original 13 Colonies that formed the United States. Now in the world we find ourselves in, our position is precarious at best. Rhode Island has to reach out and build itself up into a regional superpower or at the very least, secure its independence. However we are a weak state with Massachusetts to the north and Connecticut to our east, both of them have the strength to conquer us. It doesn’t help that our government and people don’t want to see war come to us and that strikes have engulfed the cities, stopping industrial production in its tracks. However we will soon host an election, one that puts us at a crossroads. There are the democrats who plan a revolution to shift the nation into a democrat stronghold. Then there’s the army led by General Williams Stevens Lawton who staunchly wishes to stop the election and have the military take over our government. And now comes the most enigmatic figure in Rhode Island politics, H.P Lovecraft. Lovecraft has become the head of the progressive movement in Rhode Island, vastly changed from the conservative racist writer to the progressive and well known author. His Socialist Party has swayed the public and is predicted to be victorious in the next election. However the government is soon going to at least address the issues that have brought Lovecraft to political relevancy and hopefully insure a democratic victory in the election. If Rhode Island is going to remain independent however, it will require a change in leadership. Be Democrat, Progressive, or even Despotic. Perhaps Rhode Island may rise to claim the title of New England in the years to come."
