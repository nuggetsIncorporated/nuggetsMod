    louisiana.11.d:0 "The lazy and smooth city of New Orleans had always been a thorn in the side of those who dare be tyrants in the state of Louisiana. Jazz had already infested every bone of the city before there was any crisis in the US of A, and its influence could be felt anywhere a man walked. Huey’s regime had tried to repress the spirit of Jazz and freedom within New Orleans, but the swinging city had always had the Saints marching alongside it. After Louisania’s crippling failure in the Red River War, the little faith that had kept this free city under the boot of Populists had finally shattered and fell to the ancient stone cobbled streets of the Jazz capital. Late last night, Moses went down with the representatives of the city government of New Orleans, joined by the folk of the Plaquemines Parish, to declare their independence from Louisiana. They declared that they ain’t no such thing as a tyrant who lasted long, and the soul of the city of saints can never be extinguished. The simple Cajun folk of Arcadia, joined with the people of New Orleans in their love of freedom, hatred of oppression and racism, and common lineage, declared their independence alongside them and turned their guns towards the proponents of the Longist regime. The people have already formed militias led by their marching bands, and a good chunk of the national guard and garrison force has already switched sides to support the swinging city. Barricades are placed, artillery is ready to fire, and barbed wire lines the outskirts of the city. It’s going to be a rhapsody in blue for the folks of New Orleans, but they will die to defend their liberty, their city, and their music."

    louisiana.30.d:0 "After a long and bloody conflict with Texas, we have finally vanquished them! While extravagant and vivid celebrations are being held throughout the state, inside the capitol only gatherings being held are to answer a question that will play a very influential role in our nation's future; that being what to do with our newly acquired lands. The question went to a cabinet of Huey's trusted advisors, who would present the most supported proposals to him. Many different ideas were thrown around, with one advisor suggesting that the state be made into their own personal golf course, however that was quickly thrown out after the question of how they would acquire enough lawncare equipment to adequately groom some one hundred thousand square miles of turf was brought up. Ultimately the decision came down to 2 choices; take the East and create 2 vassal states centered in the cities of Houston and Austin, or full annexation. Opponents of the first argued that we can not trust the Texan people to remain loyal, while opponents of the latter claimed that the army is already exhausted, and attempting to permanently occupy such a large swath of land would only end in disaster. Debates were fierce, however Huey ultimately decided that we would..."
    louisiana.30.a:0 "Take the East, puppet the rest!"
    louisiana.30.b:0 "Take it all, for Texan independence would be our downfall!"

    louisiana.31.t:0 "Our Texan Lands"
    louisiana.31.d:0 "After the outbreak of the Second Red River War, many thought that the conflict would last mere days, not a single soul expected that we would receive a letter from Texas announcing their complete and unconditional surrender. At the peace conference with Huey, it was decided that Louisiana would receive all lands East of the Fort Worth-Waco line and West of the Waco-Comstock line while we would receive all lands North and West of the two. While on paper it was almost equal in terms of actual size, Louisiana came into control of the Lion's share of population and industrial centers. There are some who yearned for more from the conference, particularly the city of Fort Worth, however the majority of officials are very pleased with the outcome, with our land size roughly doubling. While many lower level officials celebrated after leaving the conference, those with more experience and power began to debate the question of how to govern our newly acquired lands. Most agreed that the more densely populated North would remain Oklahoman, but the question of what to do with the South, which is sparsely populated and less developed, still remains up in the air. Proponents of full annexation have emphasized the region's rich oil deposits, and claim that the positives outweigh the negatives, however the opponents made a compelling counterpoint, saying that a vassal state would bring all the benefits of the oil without the costs of occupation. Many supporting full annexation switched sides after hearing this, showing just how decisive and well thought some of our diplomat's first opinions were. While most agreed that creating a vassal was the best course of action, the decision ultimately came to President Murray, who decided that..."

    louisiana.32.t:0 "A Nation In Turmoil!"
    louisiana.32.d:0 "Despite many advisors warning Huey of the dangers of taking full control of a nation more than twice Louisiana's size, it was decided that Texas stay under the full occupation of Louisiana. This monumental decision was almost immediately met with fierce protests from all across the nation, including manufacturers, farmers, and most notably the army. Following the outbreak of the war, many officials realized that Texas was much stronger both in the size of their army and industrial might, and came to the conclusion that if Louisiana wished to stand a chance, big sacrifices would need to be made. Huey soon signed into law the Wartime Acts, which instituted rationing, heightened conscription laws, a ban on the production of non-essential goods, and martial law. Many were supportive of the government's actions in the first few months, believing that the war would be over in quickly, however after the Texan offer of conditional surrender was rejected by Huey, support for both the government and the war took a bleak nose dive. After the full capitulation of the Texan government, many breathed a sigh of relief, believing that life would soon return to how it was before the war. The decision to permanently occupy Texas has greatly prolonged the effects of the Wartime Acts however, and needless to say nobody is happy. Desertions in the army are now at a new high, as officers are forced to tell their soldiers, many of which are still quite young, that they will not be able to return to their families. Manufacturers and farmers are also very displeased, as by law they have been restricted to only producing certain goods, which they are then forced to sell to the government for only nickles and dimes. The announcement of the acts staying in place for the next hundred days has been the breaking point for many, with factories closing, farms being abandoned, soldiers deserting, and families leaving. It is safe to say that Louisiana has entered a period of distress and exhaustion, with some of the government's worst critics calling it "a new great depression." "

Younger people have already begun to referring to Long as the Old Man of Louisiana, which Huey has frown upon. It's odd to many to think Huey's served several terms as President due to the end of term limit on the Presidency in 1939. Many wonder how long the Kingfish will stay in power."
