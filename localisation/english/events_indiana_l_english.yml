indiana.1.a:0 "Hold the Faith" # Boosts Stephenson's influence in the government
indiana.1.b:0 "no loc, but this boosts opposition" # Boosts Bedfordist influence in government. An early lead to having Branham or Duvall seize power as moderate voices in Duvall's case, or comptenency in Branham's case

 indiana.2.t:0 "Indianapolis Assembly" # Unsure how else to write this atm, but would've definitely gone into more detail
 indiana.2.d:0 "As the next election comes to the state, the Interior Bureau and the General Assembly have organized a ”Grand Assembly” to discuss the overall national situation and a wide range of solutions to the ails of Indiana in the event of both a third term of Edward Jackson and the possibility of a new face such as the evangelical William Branham, or perhaps even the ever-rising John Duvall, still serving as the Mayor of Indianapolis but shouting a massive role in the overall government. Although the Grand Assembly is to cover all issues of the state, the most notable and important come down to the industrial crisis in the north, the education crisis, and the security crisis created by these problems, which though a minority, fiercely threatens the stability of the republic. Briefing and debates will occur throughout the next couple months or less as the topic of each day is voted on."

indiana.thd.1.t:0 "The Dragon's Drunken Realm"
indiana.thd.1.d:0 "    The Grand Dragon is commander of the new Klan, albeit this should’ve gone to the Imperial Wizard, of which there is none anymore. After tireless campaigning in and across the state, Ed Jackson successfully secured a victory against the big-city Bedfordists, and the show goes along as it does now. With the status quo reassured, Jackson may continue the treacherous recovery effort for this backwards state, surrounded by far more successful neighbors who are apparently less affected by the economic devastation.\n    Regardless of the cheers after Eddy’s victory, the state is still in crisis. The crisis is only partially from the troubles addressed back in the Indianapolis Meetings, because in fact, from the ashes of the Chicago Gang Wars back in 1929, Dean O'Banion's criminal empire, reestablished in Gary after flocking from the Chicago crackdown, is likely the greatest threat... or at least, it LED TO the greatest threat in the history of the Hoosierdom, more accurately. Control over the power of the other great two "Side" Gangs in Chicago, Northside and Southside, has since fallen to Capone's Crime Family, yet the Northside, however and surprisingly, survived just barely by crawling underground and scurrying back up into Gary where racketeers continue to make a ruckus. Dean O’Banion's assassination didn't mean the end of the Northside, and in fact led to its revival as the successor, Hymie Weiss, masterminds a sort of "revenge" campaign against the Chicago Southside, and the accused State of Indiana in the assassination despite being a work of Capone.\n    Indiana's shift towards prohibition only propels the Northside's rise to power, from their seat in the northwest of the state. The wealth-racking illegal trade of booze spiraled into a booming age for the Irish mob, and created a now unmanageable battle with the Northside, rebranded as the Steel Syndicate, as their activities continue to fly under our sight, and the immense corruption they’ve created with the northern governments leaves us without a capable police force, who most have since turned on us in favor of their rum or fear of death by the mob. Our army is shattered from the inside out whenever we attempt to reclaim our cities due to their unconventional tactics, which we are not ready for, and our loyal Klansmen are being slaughtered for they are deemed the greatest hindrance to the gold, according to the Syndicate. \n    One way or another, the Syndicate needs to fall-"

### DISSIDENTS

indiana.migration.1.t:0 "Draining the Whirlpool"
indiana.migration.1.d:0 "The General Assembly, today, just passed multiple new "protection laws" as part of the continued effort to drain the communist whirlpool from both the rural south and the industrial north of the state. Governor Edward Jackson has been advised to deploy the Hoosier Community Protection, a paramilitary also known as the Knights, by the Interior Bureau, overseen by Dwight Stephenson, in what they will assure the public to be "the formation of another routine community clean-up committee". The treasonous population in Indiana organized by the FWLP, even if a small minority, is expected to respond with their own farmer and steel-worker fighters, although it's a likely possibility that most of the encounters with the FWLP will not escalate beyond tense stand-offs in barns and on the streets, but it definitely won't make the public feel any better for the time being."
indiana.migration.1.a:0 "Well like 1934, it should blow over too."

indiana.migration.2.d:0 ""STUDENTS ROUT KLANSMEN", as the booming headline read on the day’s papers. Catholic students of Notre Dame ran out to the streets during a misty day of Klan parades and patrols, hurling bricks from buildings and tackling and beating down Klansmen, before stealing their robes and parading with them. This group of students has since become known as the "Bed-Sheet Bandits", a name which has since stuck as new student, and generally anti-Klanist, groups surged in size since the previous major crackdown in 1934, which got leaked to the public, although only the small amount of dissidents really care enough.\n    It was only a matter of time before the first shot rang, and the first casualty of the Notre Dame brawl lay face-down in the red-painted street.\n\n    "STUDENT KILLED IN KLAN PATROL", as the next booming headlines came storming in. 17-year-old Johnathan Krump was shot dead after attempting to brawl with one of the armed guards defending the parade outside Notre Dame. The state, also since, has become increasingly more outraged with the violence against the "unarmed" kids, ignoring the bricks, that day... well, a minority, to say truthfuly. The majority are still too loyal to the Dragon’s hand, and seem more outraged by the fact that these kids even attacked their fellow subordinates to begin with, although they still send their condolences. The streets of Notre Dame has become a frightening fog since that day forward, as the catholics' clique continue to take up arms to contest the Klan’s control over the city in desperate attempt to overthrow the Klan's government in Notre Dame, and even South Bend as a whole, even calling in their "Bed-Sheet Bandits" yet again to tackle the Klan, but this time awaiting the moment to come in pouncing by with the piercing steel bullet.\n\n    It's insanely crucial that any more conflict be resolved before bullets go flying, and bodies start piling. Already, the Klan's reputation is beginning to feel the first blunt of the burn for the controversy around the Notre Dame brawl, so in response, Governor Dwight Stephenson, today has decided to..."

indiana.migration.3.t:0 ""I did what I could do""
indiana.migration.3.d:0 "    Although Jackson attempted to retrieve a response back from call after call dialed to the South Bend mayoral office and all other administration, the line remained silent. The line continued to lay like a wet string, undisturbed by the shaking of another end, for hours now. Ever since that kid, whoever "Crump" or something along that (he couldn't remember under the rising stress), ran like a banshee thinking he could wipe the slate of the Klan's guards only to be shot and trampled like glass, all the lines gradually, to Notre Dame, seemingly fell silent. Eventually it spread across the northern counties as the day progressed, and the lines started being completely cut, rather than those occasional crude-mouthed protests that could shout on the other end if a call ever managed to get through, finally. As of this day after, enough information rode into his dry boring-brown office to truly confirm that "numerous northern counties" decided abruptly to "secede" from the state, and an armed perimeter'd been established across a rugged line, likely since keeping with those boxy county borders would be a nightmare, itself, anyways.\n\n    The industrial north inevitably came with the symptoms of communism and those other wicked gangsters pillaging from across their hideouts across the north, ever since they busted out from Gary. Peacekeeping in that region presistently proved difficult as the unconventional and often increasingly-brutal tactics, mostly by the gangsters, tore at the already-existing military dishevelment caused by the need to redirect the economy to civil needs in effort towards recovery. Jackson didn't, however, expect a full-on secession like this to ever come to actual fruition, but it did and his eyes and ears were unfortunately not decieving him. All those times those HCP officers told him about the "brilliant" crackdown of the day on another communist or gang cell, and the daily reports from the Interior Bureau acting as if the situation finally began to be swept clean, instantaneously burnt into mere ashes that stained, not only his temperment, but the entirety of the state's survival. They'd all lied to him. The state already hated him before once his cooperation with the Klan came to the bright exposing sunlight, not helped by the unresolved economic, and now violent, disaster in the state, but who else would they vote for? Turns out they would vote for the Republicans, just not the same Republicans as before. Newer than the New Republicans, faced by the rising star named John Duvall and his "Bedfordists", who must've been behind this apparent propaganda against he, Edward L. Jackson, himself. This is all what this began to point to, right? Could his puppet master, Dwight Stephenson, even be in on this possible plot for his own gain? 'Am I considered disposable?... filthy bastards... oligarchs.'\n\n    His relationship with the state's government's never been sublime, but now they must hate him... but for what exactly? The refoundation of polarity now in Indiana gave way to this crisis, and his own party is doing it themselves. It's bound to become the greatest trial of his governorship. This is almost like the final test, deciding the future of both the state and his life. This situation is completely in his hands, as the commander-in-chief, as much as he's a mere vehicle for a shadow, but he can't even trust his peers around him anymore, especially if his newfound paranoia proves to be completely valid."

indiana.migration.news.1.t:0 "Standoff in Indiana!"
indiana.migration.news.1.d:0 "Whilst the New Republicans' domination in the State of Indiana led the Democrats into near obscurity, their resurgence within the last 3 years since the further devastation caused by the Steel War led to dangerous political polarity across the state. Most of this comes from the industrial north, where laborers almost "naturally" align with the bargaining of socialism, under the banner of the Farmers' and Workers' Liberation Party in Indiana. Since the rioting in Notre Dame's violent escalation with the death of 17-year-old student Johnathan Krump, the fire in the split between the establishment Klan-controlled Republicans and the loose Democratic resistance rose significantly within the last 24 hours after the event. Although not the most popular move with general citizens, the "radicals" of the Democratic Party have taken up arms, led by the ever-vocal anti-Klan Knute Rockne-a football coach turned catholic militant leader-in more than just the same protest against the regime in Indianapolis. The so-called "Bed-Sheet Bandits", in mockery of the Klan's uniform, seized the northern counties surrounding South Bend at around 10:00 this morning, and whilst Indianapolis is yet to make any proper response, its clear that the command in Indiana is already making their move as the situation likely seeks to move beyond a tense standoff, and towards an ideological civil war."
