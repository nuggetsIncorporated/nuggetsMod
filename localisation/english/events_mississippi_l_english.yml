 mississippi.1.t:0 "Inauguration Day"
 mississippi.1.d:0 "After must anticipation Theodore G Bilbo has returned to take his third non-consecutive term as Governor.  Bilbo is the only man to be elected to three terms as Governor of Mississippi. He was previously elected in 1915 and 1927 respectively. He comes to Jackson fresh off his win in the 1935 Democratic Primary and the General election, the former of which he whipped Paul Johnson in a runoff. Bilbo promises to do his best for the rednecks of the state and to lick the grafters in Jackson. Bilbo and his predecessor, Martin S Conner, elected in 1931 as Governor, joked about food served by the Jackson dinery."
 mississippi.1.a:0 "Bilbo!"
 
 mississippi.2.t:0 "State of Mississippi"
 mississippi.2.d:0 "Mississippi state of affairs since it left the Union in the summer of 1932 have been rough but progressive. Governor Conner has served the state since 1932 as chief executive under his reforms the budget has managed well. He also has endorsed many social programs to help those in need. Many conservatives and 'Bibloites' criticize his relationship with Louisianas said Dictator Huey Long. Since the fall of Union Conner and Long have been a close as brothers thus bringing the respective countries closer than ever. In 1934 when Long bolted to Democratic Party and joined the Jeffersonian Democrats, Conner followed. Thus, many hardline Democrats have accused Conner of treason to the party. Despite this Conner has held strong to his strong friendship with Long claiming that 20 roads have been built to connect our two great lands. Conner was unable to run in the 1935 election and instead backed a young World War veteran and lawyer Ross Barnett as the Jeffersonian Democrat. Barnett however was easily defeated by Democratic Nominee Bilbo in November."
 mississippi.2.a:0 "Interesting."
 
 
 mississippi.3.t:0 "The Man"
 mississippi.3.d:0 "Bilbo career in Mississippi is legendary. The three-time elected Governor and former Lt Governor has been a constant figure of rednecks and farmers in rural Mississippi. Bilbo is a protégé of Senator James Vardaman one of fiery populists of old who lead the original redneck revolt against the wealthy planter class of the Delta. Like his political father he had been the center of controversy on numerous occasions the latest being his de-accreditation of Mississippi colleges due to purging teachers who he thought were teaching race mixing. This issue was quickly overshadowed as he made a comeback cursing Hebert Hoover on the eve of secession. Bilbo was one of  the leading secessionists and led the debate at the secession convention which saw Mississippi leave the Union. Many however fear Bilbo recklessness may further the economic depression as he scares off northern investors with his anti-negro rhetoric. After all he’s a Klansman."
 mississippi.3.a:0 "This will be Fun."
 
 
mississippi.4.t:0 "Negro Revolt"
mississippi.4.d:0 "Angry over the recent execution of the Scotosbro Boys Negroes have siezed power in the Deleta. The forces have been organized by the Southern Tenant Farmers Unions. We suspect labor organizer Rex Douglas is behind this. He has been seen in Greenville waving their new flag. Even worse is that they have seized several armories and apear to fully armed albiet not with the best equipment. We will have to act soon or else risk them growing too powerful."
mississippi.4.a:0 "Damn Communists!"
mississippi.4.b:0 "Equality Now! (Play as Douglas)"

mississippi.5.t:0   "Pick Sucessor"
mississippi.5.d:0 "In the upcoming election it seems the Jeffersonian Democrat Party will have a firm edge. However, we need to select who from our own Primary we will endorse. On one hand we have the loyal Barnett, a man who ran for our party in 1935 and loss. On the other hand we have former US Representive and more recently our House Floor leader John E Rankin. While a tough worker for our values Rankin is a old isolationist who rather let MS stay quiet they expand. Barnett on the otherhand is agressive but has less experienced leading. He also has a streak of economic conservatism. Both have talents but only one shall rule."
mississippi.5.a:0 "Old Rankin"
mississippi.5.b:0  "Ross Barnett"

mississippi.8.d:0 "Sixty-One year old John E Rankin has inaugurated as Governor today. Rankin promised to continue reforms which lift up the farmers of Mississippi over the old yankee industralists. Rankin promised to \"seek and destroy all negro radicals in the Deleta\". Such talk was applauded by the loud mass of Mississippians."
mississippi.8.a:0 "Rankin! Rankin!"


mississippi.9.t:0  "Barnett Inaugurated"
mississippi.9.d:0 "After many hurdles Barnett was inaugurated today in Jackson. The fiery lawyer spoke of defending Mississippi sovereignty and segregation at all costs. \"That Boy Nedd Cobb does not scare me! My father fought for Southern Independence against the Yankee Invaders\". Barnett inaugurated was attended by Georgia's Eugene Talmadge and other Jeffersonian Democrats while many Democrats stayed away."
mississippi.9.a:0 "Barnett"


mississippi.10.t:0 "Douglas Shall be Crushed"
mississippi.10.d:0 "The so called nation of Douglas is nothing more than a den of drunken communist Negroe bandits. Our proud sons of the South will clean em' all out. The Mississippi Man knows how to deal with this. We will reclaim the Delata!"
mississippi.10.a:0 "No Mercy! No Retreat!"


mississippi.11.t:0 "Klu Klux Klan Army"
mississippi.11.d:0 "Our move to take Grand Wizard out of the political scene has worked even better than we thought. Simmons has formed four elite divisons of Klu Klux calvery to fight for Mississippi. As a veteran of the Spainish American War we know he will lead them valantly. "

mississippi.14.t:0 "JDP push to End Black Sufferage"
mississippi.14.d:0 "Jeffersonian Democrat  Floor Leader John E Rankin has made a speech to strip blacks of all voting rights. Rankin said, 'No negro deserves the vote in Mississippi! Shall we forget it was the stinking yankee who gave them the vote?'. Despite the fact that almost no blacks vote due to the White Primary anyhow. The question of black sufferage is odd as most sufferage laws were federally mandated thus we now have a legal gap. While many whites have rallied behind Rankin, Democrat and even some JDP members fear the impact of a Northern embargo if we outright strip blacks of the vote."
mississippi.14.a:0  "Rankin is a firey one!"

mississippi.15.t:0 "Lt Governor  Backs Anti-Reconstruction Clause"
mississippi.15.d:0 "The young Lt Governor, 'Big Jim' Eastand, has decided to back the so called anti-reconstruction clause which will ban voting for any non-whites. This comes as a suprise as the measure was so far backed only by Jeffersonian Democrats. As a major ally of Bilbo Eastland's support signals to other Democrats that it's best to fold on the issue before the JDP can use it in the next election. It is now likley blacks will be totally outlawed from the ballot box."
mississippi.15.a:0 "Eastland?"

mississippi.50.t:0 "Anti-Reconstruction Bill Sent to Governor"
mississippi.50.d:0 "Mississippi Senate passed the Anti-Reconstruction clause which shall strip negroes of any right to vote. Indeed, we will be the first Southern state to enact such a firm stance against negro rule. The clause mandates and rejects the 'evils and courruption of negro rule during reconstruction.' It's now up to Governor Bilbo to sign. Many bussiniess leaders have secrectly asked that Bilbo not sign the bill on grounds of it being useless piece of legislation. They claim that Northerners will wage economic warfare on Mississippi if we pass this. They also claim Negroes will get riled up and start committting terror attacks like in Alabama."
mississippi.50.a:0 "I shall sign"
mississippi.50.b:0 "There's no need for it, blacks don't vote."

mississippi.16.t:0 "Anti-Reconstruction Clause Passes"
mississippi.16.d:0 "Governor Bilbo proudly signed the new amendment without any regret. 'This is a new step to insure Anglo-Saxon supremacy for years to come' said the Little Governor.

Indeed, White Mississipians stand united on the sufferage question."
mississippi.16.a:0 "It was necessary, hopefully their shall be peace though."

mississippi.18.t:0 "The Death of Bilbo!"
mississippi.18.d:0 "Theodore Bilbo, our wonderful governor has passed away today in his 'Dream House' estate in Poplarville. At age 69 he left behind a legacy of white supremacy for our glorious state and he was a staunch fighter for the Anglo-Saxon people. His funeral was attended by thousands of mourners, and a statue of him is now under construction in the state capitol building. James Eastland, a longtime supporter of Bilbo, has suceeded him in the aftermath of his death. Many see this as fitting as the much younger Eastland has served as Lt Governor since elected alongside Bilbo in 1935."
mississippi.18.a:0 "A saddening day."

mississippi.19.t:0 "Mississippi wants to Join Our Faction"
mississippi.19.d:0 "We have had a mix relationship with Missisippi over the years. However, with fellow Jeffersonian Democrat Mike Conner back in charge we can likley count on a good ally. While this may stop us from our goals of annexing the state it may also save us the time and lives if we just allow them to join the Jeffersonian League. It also will insure a quick route to Tennessee."
mississippi.19.a:0 "Welcome Mississippi with Open Arms."
mississippi.19.b:0 "No way do we need those hicks. "

mississippi.20.t:0 "The Jamaica Plan"

mississippi.20.a:0 "An unatural population boom."

mississippi.21.t:0 "Lester Franklin Comes Knocking"
mississippi.21.d:0 "In 1935 you had a crowded field running for Governor of Mississippi. You had Lt Governor Murphey, former Governor Bilbo, former congressmen Paul Johnson, millionaire Hugh White, and Lester Franklin. This isn't to mention the Jeffersonian Democrats' own candidate Ross Barnett. However, it's Franklin that at the time had Bilbo most worried. Franklin was gaining a sizable following from rural rednecks though the highest position he served was as State Tax Commissioner Chairman from 1928-1932. Despite this Franklin was and is from the Bilbo camp meaning when he announced his run before Bilbo in 1935 it caused quite the confusion. Bilbo decided to meet with Franklin, whom he knew ran for Governor and failed in 1922, a deal. Bilbo, according to Franklin, said he'd back him in 1939 if he withdrew from the race. Franklin agreed and did. Now Franklin has returned to Jackson demanding Bilbo begin throwing his weight behind him, but it may only cause problems now. Plus, there are rumors that the populist even socialist-minded Franklin may be planning his own bolt."
mississippi.21.a:0 "Tell, Franklin that it's too early to Run for Governor."


mississippi.22.t:0 "Hugh White Announces Canidacy"
mississippi.22.d:0 "Along the Pearl River businessman and former mayor of Columbia Hugh L White has announced his candidacy for this year's presidency. He ran in the Democrat primary in 1936 against Bilbo but barely lost in a tough race after being mocked as a unionist. In the 4 years since he has taken the helm of the Conservative faction of the Democrat Party in an anti-Bilbo backlash. White has called Bilbo out as a fanatical demagogue who helps inflame racial tensions for power. He has made it clear when he is governor the state will finally industrialize while retaining its Southern traditions. Many conservatives and liberal Democrats are uniting behind him as the only alternative to the Long-aligned Connor and Bilbo’s Klan wing of the party."
mississippi.22.a:0 "A moderate Mississippian?"
