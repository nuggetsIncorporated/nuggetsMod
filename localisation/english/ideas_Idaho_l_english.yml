  SID_struggling_resource_economy_desc:0 "The Great War was an economic boom for Idaho, however, since then we have seen steady decline. Even throughout the Roaring Twenties, when most of the Former Union was celebrating and indulging in temporary pleasures, we already knew what was coming. We have been experiencing Great Depression like effects ever since the end of the Great War nearly 2 decades ago, and these problems have only been exacerbated by the breakup of the Union. Previously, our resources had markets, albeit few markets, to go to. Now, lumber, copper, iron, and other rare resources sit in the mines and in logging camps, untouched for years. Mining operations have been all but completely abandoned and the lumber industry has been suffering a similar fate."

  SID_lacking_industrial_sector_desc:0 "Idaho has always been dependent on the industry of the Former United States to bring in goods and luxuries, even those as simple as clothes and furniture. We have been relying on stockpiles of old goods and the many families of Idaho have been wearing tattered clothes and sitting on broken chairs. If we cannot remedy the situation soon, Idaho will find herself struggling in this post-Union world."

  SID_potato_crisis_desc:0 "While Idaho prides herself on her most recognizable crop, the Potato, the fact is that we simply cannot support our population. With the support of the Union, we had enough food to feed our entire population and then enough for export. However, with only the primitive methods that our farmers know, and with a lack of fertilizers, our surplus of food has diminished into a deficit, and it promises to only get worse as the years go by."
