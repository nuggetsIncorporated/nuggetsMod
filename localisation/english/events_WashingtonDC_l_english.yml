  WashingtonDC.1.t:0 "State of the Union Address"
  WashingtonDC.1.d:0 "In President Hoover's second term the United States plunged into a deep and dark Great Depression. \n\nBecause of the horrors of the Great Depression Hoover declared a national emergency and postponed the presidential elections for one additional year so that the economy could be sorted out before the election. Despite the precautions made the Great Depression carried on and Hoover indefinitely postponed the election until the economy could be repaired.\nMany states saw this perpetual postponement of the presidential election as a poor attempt by Hoover to remain in power as long as possible and create a de facto dictatorship. As one of many proponents against Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, among others, have stirred dissent within the United States using the postponement of the elections as their leverage. As a result of the Great Depression and the political strife and dissent it has caused, many former states have \"declared\" their independence from the Union.\nHoover now stands in front of a crowd of only a few thousand people as he addresses the dire state of the Union. Hoover declares that we are on the eve of a \"second civil war!\" and that he will \"put this country back together!\"."
  WashingtonDC.1.a:0 "Independence From the Union is Illegal, Therefore the United States is Still Whole."

  WashingtonReclamation.1.t:0 "Another war on the Chesapeake"
  WashingtonReclamation.1.d:0 "Since the secession of any state in the United States created immense tension with Washington, Maryland is certainly no different. With the stalemate in the Chesapeake Bay War of 1933, the Washington Government and Secessionist Maryland have been at perhaps the greatest odds in the North American continent, even surpassing the Red River War. Throughout the tenure of the frozen war caused by the stalemate, the two governments have been on the very razor's edge of war across the "temporary recuperation line" in the center of Maryland, with incidents on hundreds of days since the rivalry. Today, that "temporary" border proved true, its name. \n Whilst both sides of the border continued to plan ahead for a conflict like this, it seems that Washington took the initiative and executed a massive mobilization across the entire border of the secessionist Maryland. While Washington would have the far upper-hand if fighting Maryland alone, the friendships Maryland made with their southern neighbors disallows that, and in fact already drew the attention of Virginia's forces upon the news of the border crossings. Virginia, a significant house of secessionism in the region during the United States' dissolution, supported Maryland heavily, allowing the once Baltimore Republic to grow into the Maryland republic it is now, albeit the fight remained far from over with Washington. It's clear that whilst Washington began to fall on the back foot in the first war on the Chesapeake, they now completely out-gun the small Maryland, which has led Virginia to announce their intervention into the war mere hours after Hoover authorized the border crossings. War, for the second time, completely encapsulates the Chesapeake Bay."
