ssw.1.t:0 "Reactionaries Flood Our Ranks"
ssw.1.d:0 "After the successful liberation of the region of Cascadia, the Chairperson of the People's Republic has directed our intention inward. We had to cut some corners overtime during our campaigns to unite the region and many reactionaries and revisionist lackeys have slipped through the cracks and many hold signifficant positions in our country. These people uphold the bourgeois ideals of, electoralism, upholding bourgeois and racist unions such as the AFL, White chauvinism, Trotskyism, state atheism, market 'Socialism' and other preposterous ideas that if implemented will lead to the downfall of our revolution in its infancy. This internal reactionary threat may pose the most signifficant challenge to us yet!

Harry Randall's suggested a purposal that would involve our forces along the border to harbor a secret sympathizer in the Californian army as he flees to defect over our border. With our forces waiting in position to ambush the Californian border guards as they temporarily cross to try to arrest the defector. With the news of Californian servicemen dying at our hand hitting the mass media complex in California the Bourgeois dictatorship their will jump into a war like frenzy and allow us to reap the benefits.

Our high command is thoroughly studying the advice Mao gave us in this document and is now seeking to put the advice into action within our military."
