  arkansas.4.t:0 "State of Arkansas"
  arkansas.4.d:0 "When Arkansas left the Union in July of 1932 it was done with much worry and fear. While a strong Democrat state many worried of what the federal government may do it a secessionist Arkansas as such it only followed after Louisiana, Mississippi and Georgia left. The same year was when current Governor Futrell was elected.  Futrell is an old school conservative Democrat but one who occasionally can bend to times. However due to the state going bankrupt in 1934 he has begun shutting down the view social programs the state had. Futrell is backed by the legislatures but also faces much opposition albeit they are divided. Futrell remains in power due to his re-election in 1934 and plans to win the Democratic Primary this year. Arkansas may do well under such a stable leader but also may go down a dark path as we spiral further into economic depression."

Cazhort a less than glorious comeback when elected as Lt Governor in 1928. Yet in 1930 his second attempt to become Governor failed miserably.

He even overlooked new Klan Cazhort chapters in Little Rock. His fight won his the Lt Governorship in 32’ and 34’. Since then he has rebuilt the Klan into a formidable force in the state as he seeks to finally take the prize that has escaped his grasp for over a decade. "
