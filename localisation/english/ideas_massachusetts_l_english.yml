The Boston Metropolitian area is also one of the slowest growing areas in the former United States, but this is rapidly changing due to the slow trickle of European refugees coming into our Commonwealth. Boston has become a dilapidated rapidly deteriorating city with abysmal living conditions but people are so desperate for job opportunities they continue to move into the city. We must solve this massive economic rut if we are to bring our Commonwealth back to its former glory."
