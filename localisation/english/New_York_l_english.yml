    SNY_legacy_of_FDRs_impeachment_desc:0 "New York was one of the last states to secede from the Union. This reluctance was mostly thanks to Franklin D. Roosevelt. As the United States of America continued to fracture and plunge deeper into chaos, New York remained a strong ally to the Government in D.C.. That is, until Fiorello La Guardia, the mayor of New York City, found it best for the city if it was independent from the Union. Fiorello made many formal requests to FDR for the whole state of New York to finally secede from the Union, but FDR refused. Nearing the end of 1932, Fiorello threatened to secede from not only the Union but also the state of New York if things did not change. With the threat of loosing the largest and most important city of New York, the New York State Assembly and Senate pushed to remove FDR from office. In the process of impeachment, many local militias of New York State - funded by New York City - revolted against the United State's Government. This revolt would result in New York becoming the second to last state to secede from the union in December 1932. Now an independent republic, New York State officialized the impeachment of FDR and FDR subsequently fled to the District of Columbia. The New York State Assembly and Senate formed the Congress of this new nation. The next Congress would come to be more loyal to the ideals of FDR, but nothing could be done because he was impeached. Around half of Congress and many of the people of New York remember FDR fondly, the strong memory of FDR will persist in New York until another leader can come to power to satisfy the needs of the people."

Despite the impeachment eventually passing, the damage was already done. New York City no longer trusted that its best interests were being looked out for by the State. In a compromise, New York City became a highly autonomous region of New York State, with its own politics and many of the powers of an independent country."

    new_york.4.t:0 "Herbert H. Lehman Criticizes the Army"
    new_york.4.d:0 "Herbert H. Lehman, the president of New York State, made a speech this morning criticizing the actions of The Army. \"While The Army may have criticized me and my administration, I have never performed an action so foolish as to abandon the capital building in a time of great need and instability for this great country we all call home. It is clear to me that their action was uninformed and I hope they see the error in this act and decide to return to defend the capital building in Albany.\" Lehman's speech did little to change the mind or hearts of The Army and the people who support their actions."

    new_york.5.t:0 "The Albany Attack"
    new_york.5.d:0 "Early this morning, the usual protest gathered in front of the capital building in Albany. Without the army there to threaten the protesters, the size of the protest was the largest since the breakup of the Union. On the streets, the protesters called for true democracy in the republic, for Franklin D. Roosevelt to return, for the end of the slaughter of innocent protesters by the hands of the police and - until recently - the army, and or change. \"We demand Life! We demand Liberty! We demand the Right to Pursue Happiness!\" Their cries could be heard for blocks and blocks surrounding the capital building in Albany. Herbert H. Lehman attempted to address the crowd like he always does. \"I have been trying my hardest to bring Life, Liberty, and Happiness to the people of New York. But it is Congress, not I, that continually wishes to stifle our Democracy and keep our country in a situation of prolonged political deadlock!\" Lehman's speech was cut short by the sound of gunfire radiating from the crowd. Immediately, Lehman retreated into the capital building for his own safety. Soon after, a poorly known, radical left congressman walked out from the crowd and gave his speech, his firearm concealed by his suit. \"Brothers in arms, we have gathered here today not because we are satisfied and to tell Lehman he's done a good job, we have gathered here today because was are DISSATISFIED and because Lehman has NOT done a good job.\" He paused for a brief applause from the crowd. \"Today is the day we must show Lehman just how unsatisfied we are with his administration!\" More applause. \"Now follow me fellow citizens of New York, follow me in my, in our, attack on the very administration that has made our lives hell! WHEN THE CLOCK STRIKES NOON, WE ATTACK!\" More applause erupted from the crowd, many of them now blinded by the words of the congressman many of them didn't even know was a congressman. When the hour was noon, what would become known as \"The Albany Attack\" commenced. While initially lead by the congressman from before, he eventually retreated because he knew violence would ensue. In the end over two dozen protesters and guards were killed in the attack before the rest of the crowd was discouraged and gave up. While the number of people killed may have not been as much as in other tragic event in the past, it was enough to demonstrate the political instability in New York, the political violence. This attack will surely change the course of the country forever and will be remembered for many generations to come."

    new_york.84.d:0 "North America isn't the only part of the world that has suffered through the early 20th century. Following an extended, and unnecessary, occupation of the Ruhr, relations between The United Kingdom and France began to break down. Aligning themselves with their former enemy, Germany, The United Kingdom protested France's expanding influence in Europe. In 1931, tension reached a tipping point and war broke out with The United Kingdom and Germany on one side and France and Italy on the other side. Quickly, countries began joining both sides of the war. Being the leading great power in the world, The United Kingdom was the main fighting force in the Allies. German industry was still struggling to recover after the aftermath of The First World War. Supplied by The British, Germany took defensive positions in Europe as The United Kingdom focused their attention on Africa and Asia. They were able to clear France and Italy out of most of Africa except the Mediterranean coastline, where some French outposts still hold strong. In Asia, they faced much opposition against Japan, who joined the war on the side of the French after the Netherlands joined the Allies. Asia proved to be one of the most important fronts for the British, however. The British Raj supplied much needed manpower to both Germany and The United Kingdom and the resources from South East Asia gave The United Kingdom and Germany a resource advantage over the Entente side. It would be best to focus on manpower - well trained troops - when supporting the Allies in this Second World War. The British Industry is one of the largest industrial bases in the world and Germany's industry continues to rebuild as the war goes on. With more manpower, their main disadvantage can be removed and we can expect the Allies to win."
    new_york.84.a:0 "Interesting"

    new_york.85.t:0 "French/Italo/Soviet Side of the War."
    new_york.85.d:0 "Although an unlikely alliance of countries, they are united in their goal to take down The United Kingdom and Germany. Only half a decade before World War II, Italy found itself lead by Mussolini after a Fascist Revolution. Leading up to the war, France expanded her continental ambition, attempting to ensure their top spot in Europe and to forever ruin Germany. The United Kingdom did not support France's new ambitions and put their backing behind Germany. Seeking an ally in Europe, France reached out to Italy because of their natural distrust of The United Kingdom. This uneasy peace couldn't last, and eventually tensions reached a tipping point in 1931. War broke out between the Allies and the Entente. With Germany still being severely crippled due to The First World War and the Treaty of Versailles, France and Italy knew that their goal should be isolating and crippling The United Kingdom, their main threat. With their \"eventual\" victory in this war, France planned to carve up Europe to serve themselves and their allies. Needing another ally, France reached out to the fledgling Soviet Union, promising them much of Eastern Europe if they helped take out Germany and isolate The United Kingdom. Only a couple of years after the start of the war, The Soviet Union joined on the Entente. Marching through Poland, who joined the Allies, the Soviets meet the forces of Germany and Poland with British support along the Vistula River. Germany was never the Soviet's main focus, as they diverted almost half of their army to secure the Balkans and Finland in the early days of the war. This gave Germany time to build defenses, and the Entente lost their only chance to come through with an easy victory against the Allies. Japan joined France against the Allies for similar reasons, the promise of land in the Dutch East Indies (and the \"eventual\" concession of French Indochina). France fell to a Fascist revolution, similar to Italy, during the war. This Fascist French party invested even more into the war effort, in an attempt to close the technological, industrial, and resource gap between them and the Allies. While manpower is plentiful for the Entente, if we are to support them effectively it will be with advanced weaponry. With advanced weaponry, their main disadvantage can be removed and we can expect the Entente to win."
