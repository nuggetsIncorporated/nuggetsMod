 montana.1.t:0 "Power Struggle in the Treasure State"
 montana.1.d:0 "For decades, Montana has been split between East and West, between Mountain and Plains, between rural and urban, and between worker and owner. Mastering the game of politics in our state is not an easy task, but it must be done if one is to govern this unruly piece of frontier territory. \nIn the olden days, Montana could guarantee the prosperity of the people through its links with the East and West coast, but with the country collapsing, those same interests are now looking for other options. \nThe incumbent governor Elmer Holt is unpopular even within his own party. If we are to maintain the status quo, we will need to appease all the groups in the country - no matter the cost."
 montana.1.a:0 "'My favorite state has not yet been invented. It will be called Montana, and it will be perfect.'"
 montana.2.t:0 "Holt Prepares Campaign"
 montana.2.d:0 "The recent death of Governor Cooney has left Elmer Holt in charge of the administration of the state. With America in chaos, it is doubtful that either the Republican or Democratic parties will stay out of Holt's way. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that the governor maintain stability and order, even amidst terrible times of anarchy and dissolution. Unfortunately, not all his enemies think the same way; the communists under Willis Wright continually organize strikes and labor, the Republican party's two wings look for ways to subvert the state from the inside out, and Wheeler is rallying support against Holt, who he sees as unfit to run the administration. Whatever happens, it will be costly for our Big Sky state..."
 montana.2.a:0 "The situation is untenable"
 montana.3.t:0 "The Copper King"
 montana.3.d:0 "Before anti-trust laws, a group of corporate leaders, aptly named the 'Copper Kings', were the de-facto owners of the whole state of Montana. Nearly all of our infrastructure was built by them, and the people of the state recognize their untouchable legacy. However, now that the political situation has taken a turn for the worse, they too see opportunity to regain their power, now under the authority of the Ananconda Copper company. In order to get anything done, Holt will have to strike a deal with them - even if it means surrendering certain privileges."
 montana.3.a:0 "Their support will be invaluable."
 montana.3.b:0 "Anaconda Copper is not to be trusted."
 montana.4.t:0 "Montana Workers Revolt!"
 montana.4.d:0 "The worst has happened. Unable to successfully maintain the balance of power between all interest groups, governor Holt's actions have led to a workers revolt in the south and north-east, strongholds of the labor movement in Montana. William Dunne has already seized control of all unions and labor organizations currently striking and is rallying workers to pick up arms against the governor. With the situation spiralling out of control, we have no more options but to call upon the national guard and deal with the rebellion with force. Our partners in the Anaconda Copper company have already pledged us arms for the coming conflict, but we will see if they make good on their promises. Various other groups in the state are also rallying behind us in our fight against the communists in a quasi-united front, but we cannot be sure of their loyalty. For now, we stand alone."
 montana.4.a:0 "The revolution has come!"
 montana.4.b:0 "Call in the national guard!"
 montana.5.t:0 "Workers Demand Better Pay"
 montana.5.d:0 "Workers striking against Anaconda Copper are demanding that they receive better and more equal pay, as well as shorter working hours. Anaconda Copper is reluctant to give them these rights, and say that if they are granted, they will need to shut down their businesses in Missoula. What is our plan of action?"
 montana.5.a:0 "Give them what they want."
 montana.5.b:0 "Arrest the strikers and encourage corporate demands."
 montana.6.t:0 "Report on Subsidies"
 montana.6.d:0 "Recently it was discovered that funds originally meant for the army were unsent. This cash could be used to further subsidize agriculture, the backbone of our state, or, if the governor so wished, could also be used for campaigns in Dillon, Butte, and Bozeman."
 montana.6.a:0 "Our campaign needs funding"
 montana.6.b:0 "Give it to the farmers."
 montana.7.t:0 "Food Prices are Falling!"
 montana.7.d:0 "As a result of the conflicts surrounding our beautiful Montana, food prices have dropped to all-time lows. We could artifically inflate the price of food by creating scarcity, which would anger our toilers working to dig up aluminium and steel, but on the other hand, if we don't raise prices, farmers will be displeased. \nA strike might be inevitable if we choose the former option. We will need some muscle to contain it."
 montana.7.a:0 "We will support our farmers, no matter the consequences."
 montana.7.b:0 "Agriculture already gets enough money. The price will be untouched."
 montana.8.t:0 "Holt Triumphant"
 montana.8.d:0 "Governor Holt has managed to both silence the unions and make a deal with the corporations. Though disaster has been avoided, another challenge still remains. We must continue to balance the interests of both Republican and Democratic parties, before another crisis emerges."
 montana.8.a:0 "But today, we celebrate!"
 montana.9.t:0 "Red Rebellion Crushed"
 montana.9.d:0 "After a short but grueling campaign, we have managed to subdue the workers who rose up in rebellion against the government. Many of their leaders have fled to other states, undoubtedly to spread more chaos and dissidence, but for now, this is not our problem. Luckily, we managed to subdue and capture the ringleader, William Dunne, along with his entourage of followers and family members. We must decide what to do with them in the coming months. It seems for now, however, that the struggle is finally over - at least on the battlefield."
 montana.9.a:0 "Blood has been spilled, but now is the time for rebuilding"
 montana.10.t:0 "Anaconda Copper Offers a Deal"
 montana.10.d:0 "Several representatives from Anaconda Copper have offered to reformat some of their older factories into military companies. With our loose change, we should be able to offer them great subsidies and imbed them into the state apparatus."
 montana.10.a:0 "A deal is struck"
 montana.11.t:0 "Deal with the Devil"
 montana.11.d:0 "Thorelkson of the National Socialist Party of Montana has come to us with a strange deal. In exchange for the appointment of several of his cronies into office, he will guarantee us full support in our war against the Communist menace. This could potentially be extremely dangerous, but the conflict is looking grim and we might have no other options..."
 montana.11.a:0 "Take the deal."
 montana.11.b:0 "We will not allow fascists into office."
 montana.12.t:0 "The Trial"
 montana.12.d:0 "The courtroom is packed full of people as the defendant, William Dunne, takes his seat in front of a jury - perhaps not one of his peers, but of those who suffered due to his actions. It is perhaps the shortest trial in Montana state history. William Dunne and his cronies are given a variety of sentences. However, an opportunity has risen from within the Communist Party of Montana... if we were to offer some of Dunne's less-enthusiastic comrades a deal, we might be able to save face with some of the unions, and prevent a future uprising. \nSenate member Charles Taylor, for instance, could be used as leverage against the unions while preserving the communist party in its outside form. It wouldn't have nearly the same kind of power as it once did, and it would only work to serve our interests in dividing and distracting the leftists in the state. \nThe choice is yours, governor."
 montana.12.a:0 "There will be no deal. Execute all of them!"
 montana.12.b:0 "Taylor will be useful in reforming the CPM."
 
 #########MONTANA PR##########
 mpr.1.t:0 "The Red Rebellion"
 mpr.1.d:0 "The streets of Bozeman were full of strikers. Opposing them, the strikebreakers hired by Anaconda Copper held their rifles tightly. In the confusion, a shot rang out. All hell broke loose as the streets became covered in a thick layer of blood. \nWilliam Dunne held a rally after the massacre, stating that 'To all those who doubted the truth of our struggle, go to Bozeman. See the stained concrete where our state's people's blood was spilled. The call for action is not a call for violence; it is a call for justice!'. \nDespite the overtures for peace, William Dunne and his cohort have taken to organizing labor unions into militia groups, asking each one to grab their rifles and prepare for the inevitable. The first shots of our revolution were fired upon us; make sure that the last shots are fired upon them. Anaconda Copper must be destroyed, along with the puppet governor Holt."
 mpr.1.a:0 "Liberation does not come without struggle" 
 mpr.2.t:0 "Successful Liberation War"
 mpr.2.d:0 "Despite all the odds stacked against us, we have managed to defeat the capitalist dogs in Missoula, and have dispensed of the remaining Loyalist forces in the field. While resistance may continue in other parts of the state, we have thus far proved the inevitability of the communist revolution in our beautiful land."
 mpr.2.a:0 "Now, the work begins"
