  northdakota.1.d:0 "Earlier this morning, President Long of Louisiana has offered us a place in his Jeffersonian Pact. Long holds many of our populist values and he has much to offer. However, he could also get us in trouble."
  northdakota.1.a:0 "Yes, we will take him up on his offer!"
  northdakota.1.b:0 "Why shall we ally with him?"
  
  northdakota.2.t:0 "Dakotan Reunification WAR!"
  northdakota.2.d:0 "The South Dakotan government has stagnated too long and is stuck in the past, sitting idly by while their state is devastated economically by the dust bowl and great depression while the South Dakotan state government is too slow to respond to the people's issues. We will finally reunite our state in a quick and easy war. Especially since they would never suspect a SURPRISE attack on New Years!"
  northdakota.2.a:0 "Forwards!"
  
  northdakota.3.t:0 "Rally The Cavalry!"
  northdakota.3.d:0 "State Troopers have rallied and been armed with state armory equipment, horseback regiments and battalions have been formed out of local troopers and good populist citizen volunteers. But we will suffer from having our main police force being transfered to the frontlines, criminals are beginning to feel emboldened by this lack of security and police presence"
  northdakota.3.a:0 "Grasslands...Perfect for Cavalry"
