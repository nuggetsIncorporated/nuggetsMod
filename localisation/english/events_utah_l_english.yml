utah.1.t:0 "The Pocatello Proclaimation"
utah.1.d:0 "Our victorious militias and regular infantrymen have liberated the Latter Day Saint City of Pocatello. Our leader has given a fiery speech delivering the now iconic proclaimation of Pocatello. The city of Pocatello symbolized our victory due to superior will and theology. These two factors led to the glorious victory we achieved today. From Pocatello we can rightfully claim Mormon lands along the West Coast and we have revived the dream of a Mormon Hawai'i in the future, we may not pursue these ambitious goals immediately but... God is smiling upon our chosen people and is cheering at the thousands of roused masses and soldiers who cheered on this pivotal proclaimation."
utah.1.a:0 "Onwards Brothers!"


utah.2.t:0 "Mormon Ultimatium!"
utah.2.d:0 "The Mormon military junta in Utah have sent us a 'offer' but in reality this proposal is being offered to our great people at gunpoint. The Mormons seek to re-colonize the final remanent of Native self determination in these former states. It is up to us to decide our fate, should we take up the warrior ways of our ancestors or succumb to this new foe?"
utah.2.a:0 "We will fight off these new colonizers!"
utah.2.b:0 "We have no choice but to accept this ultimatium..."

utah.3.t:0 "Deseret Unification Referendum"
utah.3.d:0 "Utah has offered us a ultimatium on if our state seeks to join a new unified Deseret, if we accept we shall be incorporated into this new state led by Utah. If we refuse we will maintain our sovereignty but according to our intelligence Utah will seek to forcefully bring us into the fold, what should our course of action be?"
utah.3.a:0 "Of course we'd accept!"
utah.3.b:0 "Our sovereignty must be maintained!"
