Talmadge was first elected Governor in 1932 and took office the following year as Georgia's first President. During his first term, he came in like a tornado battling the state's highway department and congress. He used the Georgia army, commanded by personal friend Sandy Beaver, to get things moving in Atlanta. Despite his hardnose tactics many of Georgia's rural farmers have come to love and adore Talamdge thus why they re-elected him in 1934. Talmadge has promised to cut taxes for the little man, increase agricultural output, and fix Georgia's low birth rate. In 1935 the state's legislature fed up with Talmadge's strong arm tactics decided to impeach him on multiple charges. In a surprise move on New Year’s eve, Talmadge resigned as President. However, rumors have it Talmadge will run for the newly created office of Lt Governor. Many Northern papers have called Talmadge the Huey Long of Georgia."

In the audience at the rally was Huey P Long a fellow Jeffersonian Democrat who urged Georgians to elect Talmadge as President this year.

As a result, Harris was nominated as Lt Governor by both groups in what many called a dirty deal. Harris is an experienced lawmaker, in years prior being House Leader.

Thousands had come out to celebrate, and Talmadge was preparing to give his victory speech, which would be broadcasted all across the nation. When the time came for Talmadge to speak, crowds went silent as many more tuned in on radios to listen. In the speech, Talmadge thanked Georgia for making the right choice and promised to continue with his policies and reforms. For many, this was a sign of good hope, but for some, it was a sign that the repression and discrimination of the last 2 years would continue to escalate."

This group is suspected of many terror attacks, most notably the Decatur Street Massacre, which saw a bus driver purposely drive into a crowd of civilians, taking the lives of 12 innocent people. Some survivors aboard the bus say that the driver, who was African American, was chanting the party's slogan- "No liberty, no justice," shortly before driving into the crowd."

  georgia.27.d:0 "After leaving the cabin of his plane, Ellis Arnall took a look at the New York skyline and thought to himself "So is the best the damn Yankees got? I don't see what's so great about it." Arnall had seen photos of New York and heard stories about it, but had thought of it all as just "Yankee propaganda." It was not until he got closer until he realized the true magnitude of the city. The first stop on his tour was the Empire State Building, the tallest building in North America and all of the world. From 1400 feet up, Arnall could see it all; streets lined with buildings for miles without stopping, the shining blue ocean dotted with cruise liners, the bustling streets, it was truly amazing he thought, and he wanted it for Atlanta."
