   usastates_news.54.d:0 "While the Republic of California thought it could finally take a break and allow an election to occur, it seems a Second Longshoreman Strike has happened once again. And it seems this development has halted the electoral process once again, infuriating many in the left. Frank Merriam has stated that this measure is only to insure stability during these times of great unrest. However already Communist forces in California have mobilized and are beginning to shore up support in the rural Chicano regions of California. George S. Patton has lobbied Merriam to impose harsher measures on the Strikers and that Martial Law be put in place to "Prevent A Communist Takeover"."

As the nation begins it's reconstruction efforts and reintegration campaigns focused on cementing Socialism in California. It is up to question how this new nation will proceed with it's foreign policy towards the North American Continent and especially towards the radcializing West Coast. The People's Republic has promised total equality for every race, a solution to the impoverished of both the Urban and Rural Californians. And the reorganization of Californian industrial capabilities."
