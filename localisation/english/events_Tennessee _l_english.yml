McKeller sees isolationism as the best path for Tennessee as well as looking into atomic energy. Meanwhile, the Jeffersonian Democrats after years of being a joke have finally fielded the firey preacher Bob Shuler as their canidate, a mean prohibitonist.

In his speeches, Davidson is often quoted saying "Industrial society and its consequences will be a disaster for the human race." Maintaining segregation is also important to Davidson, with him believing that nearly 1/6 of the population is not "entitled to equality," and that race mixing prevents generational prosperity."
tennessee.10.a:0 "An interesting candidate to say the least..."


tennessee.11.t:0 "State Of Tennessee"
tennessee.11.d:0 "Tennessee was hesitant like many to secede in 1932 after Hoover declared a national emergency. Tennessee only did so in the fall after much of the West and Deep South had already left. While hesitant Tennessee gradually came to head with the death of America. However, the state faces a new challenge of machine politics. Boss Crump of Memphis was elected Governor in 1934 during a heated situation where he got the incumbant governor to refuse to run on suspious grounds. Since then Crump has ruled the state like he has ran Memphis for the last 20 years."

tennessee.13.t:0 "CrumpTown"
tennessee.13.d:0 "After his term ended Crumptown took on its current name at this point - The Town Hall. The original building stood out among other places because of its ornate shape with large windows facing each street corner so residents could see what life looked like around them. Also it provided housing primarily for African Americans living near there own homes; hence that nickname by itself is fitting given how segregated these neighborhoods were back then."
tennessee.13.a:0 "Nice"
