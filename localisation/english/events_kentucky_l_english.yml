  kentucky.2.t:0 "The 1942 Election"
  kentucky.2.d:0 "1942 is quite the important year for our state. Keen Johnson is offering the voters to keep a relative status quo and focus on improving living conditions for our populace. Meanwhile his main competitor King Swope is an aggressive expansionist military man, seeking expansion to the north and the foundation of a military-industrial complex. The election seems close and many seedy factors are at play, as the Mafia continues their backdoor scheming while the government is distracted with campaigning."
  kentucky.2.a:0 "Keen Johnson!"
  kentucky.2.b:0 "King Swope! March Northwards!"
  kentucky.2.c:0 "The Mafia Steps In..."

  kentucky.3.t:0 "The State of Kentucky"
  kentucky.3.d:0 "Kentucky is a state with a vast diversity in cultural influences. From American pioneer territory, to Appalachian mining folk, to Confederate rebels, the state has had a wide array of history. But with the fall of the union and the commonwealth standing alone new challenges will arise in the states’ near future. The lasting mark of prohibition and the wider Great Depression has economically crippled the state, the political turmoil is vast and ever confusing. From former Republicans, Democrats, known Dixiecrats and even the Kentucky Colonel himself the state faces many fears and beliefs for what the future should be for the commonwealth at large, some have even decided to make a “grand experiment” in political theory but I digress. The cardinal rests in its forested home but will it stay in its peaceful little space or will she spread her wings and look towards the path best traveled by those who think best. The Union is gone, but the commonwealth lives on, God Bless the Commonwealth."

  kentucky.4.t:0 "Our History"
  kentucky.4.d:0 "In the early 30's, following the collapse of North America and the emergence of her states and provinces into nations, ones in the shadows of their former collection, these new nations began to bicker and fight, much like the ones of the Old World have for centuries. In the South, Oklahoma and Texas fought in the bloody Red River War, and to the North there was a war so magificient it might as well be compared to the Wars of the Coalitions during Napoleonic times. The Steel War began in May 1934, following Ohio's steel price falling significantly, and coupled with lower wages than other states and poor unionization rates, the mafia-backed unions rose up in the streets of Toledo, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Columbus on May Day. The first mentioned was annexed into a more pro-union (not to mention mafia-influenced) Michigan later that month, and Ohio invaded the next day to reclaim it's territory. The Mafia, concerned about Ohio's progress, reached out to Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia to form a coalition to beat back Ohio.Kentucky and West Virginia immediately agreed, with the price being mafia pressure to end prohibition in the former and support of the steel and coal unions in the latter. They stuck on the first of July, defeating Ohio in the Battles of Cincinnati (forming a city-state following the battle) and Vienna, with a distracted and demoralized Ohio losing the critical Battle of Ford Factory the following week. With Indiana's entrance into the war, and Illinois seeming it too may join, Ohio was forced to seek peace. In exchange for the steel prices returning to it's pre-collapse equivalent, Ohio would regain de jure control of Toledo and all lands occupied by the coalition. Two years have passed since the Treaty of Springfield, and Ohio is hungry for revenge. From the banks of the Mississippi to the shores of the Ohio, Kentucky stands strong and worried on it's neighbor's potential return to power. Shall she seek the protection of the Mafia, to stay with a non-corrupt republic, or perhaps a more... radical option?"
