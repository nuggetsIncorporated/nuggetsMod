  LMO_lil_dixie_desc:0 "Little Dixie was always a distinct region of Missouri. Historically our region was built off of plantation slave labor for cash crops such as hemp and tobacco. The region is staunchly conservative and dedicated to preserving white supremacy so the Republican dominated secession government of Missouri was an outrage to Little Dixie and. Locals began arming themselves and taking up the ways of our Confederate Bushwacker elders, the secession of Little Dixie occured in 1934 after the Missouri secession crisis. Our independence is tenious at best and the peace is narrowly being held."
