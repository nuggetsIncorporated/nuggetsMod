    greenland.1.t:0 "Starting Situation for Greenland"
    greenland.1.d:0 "Greenland has always been dependent on Denmark for financial and other substantial support. *Removed False Lore* With nowhere else to go, many tens of thousands of Danish fled on many fleets - most set sailed for Iceland, however 5 fleets set sail for Greenland and in one of these 5 fleets was the King of Denmark. Even through the icey and turbulent waters, 3 of these 5 fleets have already arrived in Greenland, considerably boosting the population of the coastal cities. Many on the first 3 fleets believe the 4th fleet isn't too far out and is stranded on a nearby island, and a lot of people are pressing their belief that we should send an expedition to find them.\n\n You can play with either the Danish bonuses and have the ability to search for the 4th and 5th fleets as the game goes on, or you can play as just Greenland with no extra bonuses."
