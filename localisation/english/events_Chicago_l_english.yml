## Seperation and Reunification
 chicago.1.t:0 "Chicago Communists Declare Independence!"
 chicago.1.d:0 "After the memorial day massacre of striking workers and their wives by the police & armed forces of the state of Illinois, the entire city of Chicago and its surronding metropolitian area have broken out in armed revolt. Mobs of workers and disgruntled residents have stormed police precints and broken into armories and the Communist Party is taking initiative in their leadership of the revolt. A new communist government has been declared in Chicago and the state of Illinois is already preparing to execute an offensive to reclaim their largest city, and among the largest cities in North America, to restore order and "strike the "Red Menace" in the heart"."

 chicago.2.t:0 "Communists Proclaim a New Illinois"
 chicago.2.d:0 "The Chicago Revolt, led by the Communist Party of Illinois under Claude Lightfoot, has triumphed over the Illinois government and supporters, capturing Springfield in a bloody battle and rushing down south to Marion. Communist rule has begun to be cemented as opponents of the new regime are being rounded up and await trial, some already facing brutal execution, and the communists have begun nationalizing key industries in the state. Bourgeois commentators are trembling at the prospect of one of America's most industrious cities, and now states, falling to the red menace, and many expect other states in the Steel Belt to fall next. Neighboring non-communist countries have their bordering armies on total alert in fear of any possible excursions and spillover from the conflict, despite its seeming conclusion."
