    POLITICS_WILLIAMDUNNE_DESC:0 "William 'Bill' Dunne has been part of socialist movements from the age of 16. Since then, he has rose through the ranks of the CPUSA, and replaced Willis L. Wright as the leader of the party's chapter in Montana. \nDunne is a no-nonsense orthodox Marxist-Leninist, and proclaims his new movement off of the support of the mining and lumber unions within the state. Now that the US has entered into a state of anarchy, Dunne hopes to unite the country once again, but this time, with the science of Marxism-Leninism."
