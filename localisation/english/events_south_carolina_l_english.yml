    south_carolina.5.t:0 "Blease wants Guarantee"
    south_carolina.5.d:0 "South Carolina Governor Blease wants us to guarantee his country's independence. He believes North Carolina wants to undermine his nation's sovereignty. If he is correct that would put North Carolina's boarders on our doorstep, which isn't a good thing. On the other hand we could risk a serious war as our northern border could offer a easy path for the Tar-Heels to impale Atlanta."

    south_carolina.7.t:0 "Brynes Given More Powers"
    south_carolina.7.d:0 "For years the Governor of South Carolina has mostly been a ceremonial position with little actual power. Now, as it's essentially the highest office of the land, the General Assembly has relented to giving the Governor more power and let go of some of the various rules to weaken the Governorship's powers."

    south_carolina.8.d:0 "Reformer Governor Brynes wants to join the Southern Defense Council.

    south_carolina.9.t:0 "Bleaseism"
    south_carolina.9.d:0 "Coleman Blease is a former Governor and US Senator of South Carolina. Blease was first elected Governor of South Carolina in 1910 as a defender of White upcountry mill workers. He would become a chaotic force in state politics, liberally using his power of pardons, ignoring prohibition and encouraging lynchings. He would win re-election in 1912 but would fail in his efforts to run for the Senate. Throughout the 20s he'd continue trying and failing to run for statewide offices. He would win a brutal race for the Senate seat in 1924 against Brynes, which would launch him into being a national advocate for White Supremacy. He'd lose his seat in 1930 only to run for Governor in 1934 and lose to Johnston. In short, while it seems like Bleaseism is on the decline he has been known to make powerful political comebacks after long streaks of defeat. After all, he managed to win 43% of the vote for Governor in '34. Thus, he remains a powerful force in state politics despite his many foes. If given the political opportunity, he is likely to make his comeback. "
    south_carolina.9.a:0 "Will he return?"

    south_carolina.10.t:0 "Blease in Georgia" 
    south_carolina.10.d:0 "Former Governor Blease was reported to be in Augusta, Georgia today endorsing Charles Redwine for Governor Eugene Talmadge for Lieutenant governor Governor. During a stump speech he denounced the current Governor Ed Rivers as a 'tool of Savannah Catholics' and said that if he was not defeated, Catholic Aristocrats on the coast in Savannah could build a new 'dominion of Popery' in Georgia. Notably in his speech Blease failed to mention incumbent Governor Johnston, whom he's feuded with since his last defeat for the Governorship in '34. Advisors of the Governor wonder if this perhaps shows he may be focusing on the next election for Governor, which Johnston won't be legally allowed to run in."
    south_carolina.10.a:0 "Perhaps he will leave us alone?"

He has argued that he will work with the state legislature to build public works projects and help the people of the state. He argued only compromise and building a beautiful state is what will get South Carolina out of the Depression. Former US Senator and fellow Charlestonian, James F Brynes, is known to be backing the charismatic Maybanks.

He has claimed it will only encourage 'loaferism' and 'bums' to keep laying out of work. He also slammed the idea that negroes could also recieve welfare stating that they shouldn't be able to apply for any state sponsored welfare program.

    south_carolina.16.d:0 "South Carolina and it's President 'Jimmy Brynes' offer us membership in it's new alliance. Brynes seeks free trade into the Caribbean and into the Atlantic. He believes our powerful navy would be key to that. He also believes our relatively progressive domestic agenda is in lockstep with his own thus we make natural allies. He has brought up memories of us being the 3rd state to secede in 1861 thus Florida and South Carolina have always been friends. In accepting South Carolina as ally we would open up a powerful and much needed detterent to both Alabama and Georgia invading our flat borderlands. "

    south_carolina.17.d:0 "After the grand opening of several Tobacco processing factories  across the state this weekend an  angry 'Cotton Ed' Smith stormed into our office to chew us out. Cotton Ed spent over an hour denouncing industrialization and demanding the state stick to cotton planting and harvesting only. He said that building factories is 'the yankees way' and that we should focus on expanding agricultural land instead of wasting money building 'yankee sweat shops in our Southern republic'. The old man said he will use all the power as  Agriculture Commissioner to fight the industrialization of the state in the future. With a spit of tobacco juice from his mustached face he left our office, muttering about the 'damn yankees'. "

He has made it clear any who enter the state in effort to stop textile workers will be deported via the army.

    south_carolina.20.d:0 "South Carolina has come to us with an offer of dominionship. In short their new Governor James Brynes has offered us protection and shared economic progress if we allow them to become our 'mother country'. While this may seem out of nowhere South Carolina and Barbados share a strong colonial connection. In the 1600s many of the South Carolina founders were sons of the Barbados English planter elite. Thus, many South Carolinians can trace their ancestors to Barbados.  The states ambassadors claim that if we allow them control they will not intrude on our internal matters. Many of our people are skeptical of this but on the other hand, should anyone attack our small Island we have little chance of victory. Thus, perhaps a protector is needed. "
    south_carolina.20.a:0 "We accept the offer!"

    south_carolina.21.t:0 "State of South Carolina"
    south_carolina.21.d:0 "South Carolina is a small newly independent Republic surrounded by two larger republics. While by no means weak the state has struggled since the end of the Union four years prior. South Carolina unlike many other states lacks a strong executive branch with the legislature being more powerful. This has made things tough for the Governor of the state. In 1934 strikes broke out in textile mills in the upstate which were put down using the army via orders from Governor Ibra Charles Blackwood. In the aftermath, Democrats elected a pro-textile worker state representative Olin D Johnston to the Governorship that year. Johnston was himself a former textile worker along with being a Great War veteran. Gov Johnston however has faced swift resistance from the conservative state legislature dominated by the Lowcountry conservatives.  Last year he used the army to try to force out highway department members he fired only to have them stand their ground. During this debacle, he was denounced by the General Assembly and branded a tyrant. Due to this, he was stripped of even more powers as Governor. As it stands the pro-worker Governor can't even count on his cabinet who are all elected and not appointed as in most states."

Blackwood served as Governor from 1931 to Jan 1935 after defeating Johnston in the 1930 Democratic primary.Blackwood was a conventional conservative Southern Governor of his time. In 1934 he reacted harshly when thousands of upcountry textile workers went on strike. He ordered civilians deputized to help patrol mill towns which lead to the death of strikers in altercations. His death takes a possible contender for the 1938 Governorship out of the running."

    south_carolina.24.d:0 "Following black uprisings in Mississippi, Alabama and Virginia, Cole Blease is calling for their state governments to crush them into black dust. He said the rebellions are due to blacks being emboldened by Southern moderates and Yankee propaganda. He claims the only way to maintain White Supremacy is via the sword. Agriculture Commissioner Cotton Ed has also made a public speech in Columbia calling for all true Southern men to once again put on the Redshirt snd smite the negro menace. Many officials are now clamoring for some sorta of action and anxieties are high due to our own high black population. South Carolina remains a strictly segregated state. Many racial moderates including Johnston and the Charleston faction fear events in the other Dixie states may encourage a violent White backlash which will upend the relative racial harmony of the republic. Not to mention further empower the likes of racial demagogues like Smith and Blease."

The visitor is none other than former State Supreme Court Judge Eugene S Blease, the younger brother of Cole. He comes with an gift of political friendship from his brother, a offer of sorts. Eugene explained that he and his brother harbor no ill feelings towards the Governor despite running against him twice for the office. They claim it was only politics but in 1938 the Governors race will be about survival. They claim its a matter of upcountry true men vs low country blue bloods. We are both upcountry men who represent textile workers. Why not align? A Johnston Coleman alliance would be unbeatable according to the Judge. Indeed if we back Blease next year he'd endorse us in 1942 for Governor.So shall we ally with the old man from Newberry?"

The Mannings and Smiths could have a bright future in the state if the Cotton Ed would work with Manning. After the end of the conversation, Cotton Ed asked if Manning would protect cotton.
