     SFL_cancel_elections_desc:0 "President Sholtz has decided that the old, senile Fred Cone, the Democrat nominee for President, is too old for the job. Why let such a weak man lead our nation after four great years of progress under yours truly? Furthermore, Cone opposes the bonus bill like much of the do-nothing state legislature. His election will only spell headaches for much of the already suffering state."

    SFL_militia_defense:0 "Militia Defense"
       SFL_militia_defense_desc:0 "Our army is mostly aimed at offensive acts, thanks to General Lowry. With possible enemies all around us we must drill the army into being as efficient at defending as they are at attacking."
    
    SFL_social_programs:0 "Social Programs"
       SFL_social_programs_desc:0 "President Sholtz ran in 1932 on a platform of helping the little man.

      SFL_kick_fascists_out_army_desc:0 "While General Lowry has long been a loyal ally to our government some of his men have become open fascists. His Florida Legion, the Florida branch of the American Legion, has many roughnecks joining on the basis of them being in the current Army. Some of these men have been calling President Sholtz the "Fat Yankee Kike", based on his Northern Jewish origin. Such things are causing trouble within our coalition.

  SFL_generalismo_desc:0 "General Lowry isn’t such a bad guy.  He just wants a bonus bill for his war buddies, but although we can’t give it to him we can give him our respect. Kicking him out of the army might escalate the problem. The people seem to like him too much, plus he agrees with us on segregation."

    SFL_pearl_antilles:0 "Pearl of the Antilles"
