 free_negro_state.1.d:0  "Nergoes from across the Deep South have met to officially create a government for our new nation. While the young Angelo Herndon had served as Provisional President during our struggle for Independence against Alabama, many have started to question his leadership and goals now that the immediate crisis is over. Among those voices is Ned Cobb, a guerilla fighter and ideologue who bombed and raided armories from the old Alabama government. Cobb dreams of uniting the Deep South fully under Negroes and breaking up the plantations for good, while Herndon believes we should take a more pragmatic approach, biding our time to industrialize, work with sympathetic liberals and socialists in the North, and uplift the oppressed black citizenry of what used to be the heart of Jim Crow. " 
 free_negro_state.1.a:0  "Herndon Stays" 
 free_negro_state.1.b:0  "Cobb should lead us!" 

  free_negro_state.3.t:0 "Free Negro Republic asks Us for Help" 
 free_negro_state.3.d:0  "After winning their war against Alabama, the Free Negro State has called on us to defend them and their allies if attacked. Young President Herndon has begged us for guarantees that New York will protect their newly founded nation from \"Negro hating Dixie states\". In doing so we will no doubt become more entangled in the South as a whole. However, this could help us spread democracy to the Jim Crow region and thus further our influence. On the other hand, we have our own racial and labor issues that could be exacerbated if we go down South in the name of a bunch of black communists." 
 free_negro_state.3.a:0  "We will defend the rights of Blacks" 
 free_negro_state.3.b:0  "We must not help Commies!"
 
 free_negro_state.4.t:0 "Black Rebels are Working in Georgia" 
 free_negro_state.4.d:0  "Blacks are now working in South Georgia to rebel. We're getting close. They should be ready soon enough." 
 free_negro_state.4.a:0  "Everything is going as planned..." 
 
 
 free_negro_state.6.t:0 "Negroes have Risen up in Savannah" 
 free_negro_state.6.d:0  "Negroes in Savannah have taken up arms against us. They have seized several armories along the coastal region of the nation thus cutting us off from our navy. They appear to be led by infamous Negro-Communist James Ford, and have formed a breakaway state called 'Shermanland'. Damn coloreds named the country after the dastardly General Sherman! We must act soon or risk the rebellion spreading further inland." 
 free_negro_state.6.a:0  "We must act soon!" 
 
 free_negro_state.7.t:0 "Free Negro State will Protect Shermanland" 
 free_negro_state.7.d:0 "Free Negro State's President Herndon has issued a threat that \"no one shall lay a finger on Shermanland\". This is a clear warning to us. We must now be ready for a two front war."
 free_negro_state.7.a:0 "Should have executed Herndon when we had the chance."
 
 free_negro_state.8.t:0 "Shermanland Question" 
 free_negro_state.8.d:0 "Shermanland has dug into the Coastal region and raised an army. Likewise with Free Negro State's guarantee over them, we will have to fight a two front war. On top of that, New York may also decide to get involved in order to protect Free Negro State. However, our people clamor for war. General Lindely Camp says if we are able to quickly take out Shermanland, we can hold Savannah down to keep Yankees out. Likewise, he feels Herndon's boys aren't prepared for a war like this. In 1872 we threw out the carpet bagger and the negro. Can we do it again?"
 free_negro_state.8.a:0 "Strike them Down"
  free_negro_state.8.b:0 "There is nothing we can do now."
