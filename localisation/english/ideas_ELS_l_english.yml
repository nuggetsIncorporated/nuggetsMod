    els_civic_directory_infighting_desc:0 "Failures of the state have been concluded to be the fault of Martinez, albeit most are really externally-affected issues beyond, or that have eventually moved beyond, his control. This still isn't an excuse for the administrations inefficiencies and weakness is beginning to expose itself to the internal factions of the prolonged "Civil Directory" that still cannot seem to agree on how to dissolve itself. The Civic Directory is factionalizing as trustworthiness in Martinez grows weaker and weaker, and Salinas, the hidden puppetmaster, gains more and more authority over all other factions. We pray to the Lord and Saviour the government doesn't implode into a shadow civil war, that he will guide us through the cave."
