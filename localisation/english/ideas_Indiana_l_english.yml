    SIN_sin_what_gop:0 "What Ol' Party?" #kind of usless idea, will probably remove
    sin_what_gop_desc:0 "While the Klan has partially maintained the title of the Grand Old Party, it's without doubt that the GOP were absorbed into the Ku Klux Klan in 1934. The last "truer" reminants of the old now sits in the hands of Edward Jackson's "liberal" coalition as a mere fragment of its former self."
    
    SIN_sin_segregation:0 "The Great Migration"
    sin_segregation_desc:0 "The cause of this great migration of black, former, Americans can be explained a little more simply. On one end, the industrialization of the North offers far greater opportunity and living for the negroes, and secondly the disaster of the uncontrolled, since the Federal collapse of North America, Jim Crow doctrine continues to bring further violence against the negro populations across the deep southern confederal republics leading to even earlier, than anticipated, migration and in far higher numbers than previously prepared for. This causes continued havoc on the stability of the northern republics who cannot always keep up with the surge in population, and they've often failed to meet the heightened quotas to support the new expanded cities and towns. Worse, for Indiana and perhaps some parts of Black Legion Michigan, is the now even higher amount of ethno-centric campaigns against the imcoming negro populations, which while mostly managed by the more "liberal" sentiments of Indiana's Ku Klux Klan along with the government's continued intervention against lynchings and other heinous actions to fufill their "friendly klan" policies which do not entirely focus on race as solid issue, the Michigan Black Legion, the most powerful Klan faction in the Great Lakes republic, proceeded to darastically accelerate their violence against the negroes, and still causes outright bloody gun battles on the streets in many occasions on the basis of race."
