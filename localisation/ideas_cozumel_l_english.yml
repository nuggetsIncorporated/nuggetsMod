  COZ_government_in_exile_desc:0 "Ever since the Caste War resumed and Cruzob was reconstituted Rafael Melgar's government was forced to flee as the Maya's resoundley crushed them at the battle of Chan Santa Cruz. Melgar and his forces loyal to him fled to Cozumel. A mostly Maya island but a safe haven for him as the Cruzob seemingly cannot take it, yet... Melgar is determined to retake Quintana Roo and then the entire Yucatán peninsula. The only issue is that Melgar's government lacks legitimacy and the local Cozumel populace is weary towards the Status Quo government."
